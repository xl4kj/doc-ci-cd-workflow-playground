Functionalities
################

The IT-Wallet System provides Users with a simpler, faster, and more secure way to access services. This service is delivered through the use of a Wallet Solution, whose User Experience is structured into three main phases: pre-use, use, and post-use.

   :name: User Experience phases of Wallet usage
   :alt: User Experience phases of Wallet usage
   :width: 100%


The following sections focus on the usage and post-usage phases. They define the functional requirements supporting the User Experience for the Activation, Acquisition, Presentation, Management, and Deactivation phases, along with interaction requirements related to error management, assistance requests, and feedback collection.

The Official Resources include recommendations on the required User-Wallet Instance interactions and design best practices that promote consistency across different Wallet Solutions in terms of how functionalities are accessed and used.


Activation of the Wallet Instance
**********************************

Activation enables the User to access the Wallet Solution's functionalities for securely obtaining, presenting, and managing their Electronic Attestations. The activation process involves User Authentication with the Wallet Instance using their digital identity, which enables the generation of the PID.

Below are the functional and the User Experience requirements that the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee via their Wallet Solution:

- the User downloads the Wallet Solution onto their device to generate their Wallet Instance;
- the User sets an unlock PIN for their Wallet Instance if one has not been previously set in the app. In addition to the PIN, the User can decide to use their own unlock mechanism used within the device and managed at the operating system level (e.g., biometric authentication) as an alternative to the PIN. The User uses the unlock method whenever an authorization is required to ensure security and protect their information;
- the User reviews all relevant information regarding the activation process and service usage. Additionally, the User reads any policy from the Provider and PID Provider and/or the service's terms and conditions. The User gives their consent to proceed or declines to cancel the operation;
- the User selects an Authentication option from those available;
- the User completes the Authentication flow with the National Identity Provider’s service;
- the User receives confirmation of the Authentication process outcome. If successful, the User views a preview of their PID. The User confirms the previewed information to proceed with Wallet Instance activation, or cancels the operation;
- the User authorizes the operation using the unlock method previously set;
- the User receives confirmation of the successful activation of the Wallet Instance.


The Wallet Provider MUST allow the User to remove the PID issued during the activation phase. In addition, the PID Provider SHOULD allow the User to revoke the issued PID through a specific Touchpoint. The Wallet Provider MUST allow the User to always have the option to request the deactivation of their Wallet Instance, even in the absence of the device on which it was installed. For further details, please refer to the `Deactivation of the Wallet Instance`_ and `Management of Electronic Attestations`_ sections.

In case of errors using the Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee that the User receives consistent messages that inform them and guide them toward resolving the issue. For further details, please refer to the `Error Management`_ section.


Issuance of Electronic Attestations of Attributes
**************************************************

Once activation is complete, the User MAY obtain one or more Electronic Attestations of Attributes within their Wallet Instance.

Depending on the User’s specific needs, the type of Electronic Attestation of Attributes, and the offerings available from the Wallet Provider, the Electronic Attestation of Attributes Provider, and the Authentic Source, the request of Electronic Attestations of Attributes can occur in two ways:

- **From the Wallet Instance Catalog**: the User explores the list of Electronic Attestations of Attributes provided by the Wallet Solution, selects the one of interest, and initiates the request process, concluding with the issuance of the Electronic Attestation of Attributes in the Wallet Instance.

- **From a Touchpoint of the Authentic Source** (or the Electronic Attestation of Attributes Provider if it coincides with the Authentic Source): the User interacts with the digital service of the Authentic Source, allowing them to get a specific Electronic Attestation of Attributes in their Wallet Instance via an Engagement Button.

Although the initiation methods for requesting the issuance may differ, the request flows share a similar structure and process. Below are the functional and the User Experience requirements of the issuance of an Electronic Attestation of Attributes from the Catalog that the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee via their Wallet Solution:

- the User accesses their Wallet Instance using the unlock method previously set;
- the User selects the Electronic Attestation of Attributes they wish to request from the available options in the Catalog;
- the User views the PID data, if required by the Authentic Source for the request of the Electronic Attestation of Attributes, the name of the related Electronic Attestation of Attributes Provider, and any related information policy. The User gives their consent to proceed, presenting their PID data to the Electronic Attestation of Attributes Provider, or cancels the operation;
- the User views a preview of the Electronic Attestation of Attributes. The User confirms the data shown in the preview to proceed with the request or cancels the operation;
- the User authorizes the operation using the unlock method previously set;
- the User views the positive outcome of the request;
- the User views the details of the requested Electronic Attestation of Attributes, including: the data contained in it, the name of the Electronic Attestation of Attributes Provider who issued the Attestation, and the name of the Authentic Source;
- the User has access to all issued Electronic Attestations by navigating the Wallet Instance.

The Wallet Provider MUST allow the User to remove an Electronic Attestation of Attributes through their Wallet Instance at any moment. In case of absence of the device where the Wallet Instance was activated, the Wallet Provider MUST allow the User to deactivate the entire Wallet Instance through a specific Touchpoint. In addition, the Electronic Attestation of Attributes Providers SHOULD allow the User to revoke the issued Digital Credentials through specific Touchpoints. For more details, please refer to the `Deactivation of the Wallet Instance`_ and `Management of Electronic Attestations`_ sections.

In the event of communication issues between the systems of the Electronic Attestation of Attributes Provider and the Authentic Source, or if administrative or technical processes prevent the immediate issuance of the Electronic Attestation of Attributes, the actors involved MAY support a deferred issuance process. In this case the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee that:

- upon reaching the final step of the process, the User visualizes a message prompting them to wait until the Electronic Attestation of Attributes can be issued.
- The User is informed by the Electronic Attestation of Attributes Provider once the Electronic Attestation of Attributes becomes available.

If the User encounters incorrect data in an already obtained or in-progress Electronic Attestation of Attributes, the Wallet Provider SHOULD guarantee the User appropriate assistance via their Wallet Instance.  For more information, please refer to the `User Assistance`_ section.

In case of errors using the Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee that the User receives consistent messages that inform them and guide them toward resolving the issue. For further details, please refer to the `Error Management`_ section.

If an Authentic Source (or an Electronic Attestation of Attributes Provider, should it coincide with the Authentic Source) intends to implement an Engagement Button to initiate the request process from their Touchpoint, they MUST ensure compliance with the graphical appearance and implementation requirements for the Engagement Button, as outlined in the :ref:`brand-identity.rst` section.

Layout of Electronic Attestations
==================================

The Electronic Attestations obtained within the Wallet Instance SHOULD be displayed in a list within a Preview View. In this case, the Electronic Attestations MUST ensure a high level of recognizability and accessibility [REF_ACCESSIBILITY] of the information contained. Below are the requirements for displaying the Electronic Attestation that each Wallet Provider MUST adhere to in order to provide a consistent and accessible consultation and usage experience:

- the Electronic Attestation MUST be displayed correctly across all devices, ensuring a consistent experience on screens of varying sizes;
- the name of the Electronic Attestation MUST be clearly visible and always displayed in both the Detail View and the Preview View;
- the Electronic Attestation, both in the Preview View and the Detailed View, MUST display its status if different from valid and MAY display it if valid. The Preview View MAY also include additional attributes to enhance the User Experience and management; for example, it MAY display the name or logo of the Electronic Attestation of Attributes Provider or the PID Provider;
- the layout of elements in the Preview View of the Electronic Attestation MUST be optimized for scalability and usability, especially when multiple Electronic Attestations are displayed on the same screen;
- the Electronic Attestation MAY adopt a card format, in line with approaches already used by other Wallets in the market, to mirror the appearance of a corresponding physical document. When applicable, the digital nature of the document MAY be indicated, such as by labeling it as a "digital version" in the layout;
- the Electronic Attestation MUST display the same information in the Detail View as shown in the Preview View and MAY include additional details;
- the Electronic Attestation MUST include Action Buttons in the Detail View to allow for management, as outlined in the `Management of Electronic Attestations`_ section.


Presentation of Electronic Attestations
****************************************

The presentation process allows the User to access a service or demonstrate ownership of certain data or their eligibility to perform a specific action. The presentation of Electronic Attestations and their subsequent verification involves interaction between two parties: the User and the Relying Party. This can take place in two main ways, depending on the circumstances and context of the interaction:

- **Proximity Presentation**: the User presents the PID and/or EAA data through the Wallet Instance, directly to a Verifier or to a Relying Party's device designated for in-person verification.

- **Remote Presentation**: the User presents the PID and/or EAA data through the Wallet Instance, to a Relying Party configured for online verification, for instance, to Authenticate and access the services offered.


Proximity Presentation
=======================

Proximity presentation allows the User to present the PID and/or EAA data via their Wallet Instance, using one of two methods:

- **Supervised mode**: the User presents the PID and/or EAA data through the Wallet Instance to a Verifier equipped with a dedicated verification app or system (e.g., law enforcement officer, pharmacist).

- **Unsupervised mode**: the User presents the PID and/or EAA data through the Wallet Instance to a designated device (e.g., turnstile, ATM).

Below are the functional and the User Experience requirements that the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee via their Wallet Solution.

**Supervised Mode**

- The User accesses their Wallet Instance using the unlock method previously set;
- the User navigates to the feature dedicated to QR Code generation;
- the User presents the generated QR Code to the Verifier acting on behalf of the Relying Party, who scans it using the designated verification app or system;
- the User reviews the requested PID and/or EAA data, the name of the requesting Service Provider, and any related policy. The User decides whether to present any non-mandatory PID and/or EAA data (Selective Disclosure). The User provides consent to proceed or cancels the operation;
- the User authorizes the operation using the unlock method previously set;
- the User receives confirmation of the successful presentation.

In case of errors using the Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee that the User receives consistent messages that inform them and guide them toward resolving the issue. For further details, please refer to the `Error Management`_ section.


**Unsupervised Mode**

- The User accesses their Wallet Instance using the unlock method previously set;
- the User navigates to the feature dedicated to QR Code generation;
- the User presents the generated QR Code to the designated device (e.g., a turnstile) of the Relying Party for scanning;
- the User reviews the requested PID and/or EAA data, the name of the requesting Relying Party, and any related policy. The User decides whether to present any non-mandatory PID and/or EAA (Selective Disclosure). The User provides consent to proceed or cancels the operation;
- the User authorizes the operation using the unlock method previously set;
- the User receives confirmation of the successful presentation.

In case of errors using the Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee that the User receives consistent messages that inform them and guide them toward resolving the issue. For further details, please refer to the `Error Management`_ section.


Remote Presentation
====================

Remote presentation allows the User to present the PID and/or EAA data by interacting with a Relying Party's Touchpoint through a designated Engagement Button.

This presentation can occur in two different modes, depending on the type of device used to access the service:

- **Same-device mode**: when the User accesses an online digital service using the same device on which the Wallet Instance is installed;

- **Cross-device mode**: when the User accesses a digital service using a different device from the one where the Wallet Instance is installed.

Below are the functional and the User Experience requirements that the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee via their Wallet Solution.

**Same-Device Mode**

- The User clicks the Engagement Button provided on the Relying Party's Touchpoint;
- the User accesses their Wallet Instance using the unlock method previously set;
- the User reviews the requested PID and/or EAA data, the name of the requesting Relying Party, and any related policy. The User decides whether to present any non-mandatory PID and/or EAA data (Selective Disclosure). The User provides consent to proceed or cancels the operation;
- the User authorizes the operation using the unlock method previously set;
- the User receives confirmation of the successful presentation within the Wallet Instance;
- the User returns to the Relying Party's Touchpoint, where they see confirmation of the completed presentation.

In case of errors using the Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee that the User receives consistent messages that inform them and guide them toward resolving the issue. For further details, please refer to the `Error Management`_ section.


**Cross-Device Mode**

- The User clicks the Engagement Button provided on the Touchpoint of the Relying Party while accessing the service from a different device than the one where the Wallet Instance is installed;
- the User accesses the desired Wallet Instance from the device where it is installed, using the unlock method previously set;
- the User scans the QR Code provided by the Relying Party using their Wallet Instance;
- the User reviews the requested PID and/or EAA data, the name of the requesting Relying Party, and any related policy. The User decides whether to present any non-mandatory personal data (Selective Disclosure). The User provides consent to proceed or cancels the operation.
- the User authorizes the operation using the unlock method previously set;
- the User receives confirmation of the successful presentation within the Wallet Instance;
- the User returns to the Relying Party's Touchpoint and views confirmation of the completed presentation.

In case of errors using the Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee that the User receives consistent messages that inform them and guide them toward resolving the issue. For further details, please refer to the `Error Management`_ section.


Authentication
.......................

Authentication is a specific use case of remote presentation that allows the User to securely access services provided by both public and private Relying Parties. This is achieved by presenting the PID and, if necessary, a set of Attributes contained in the obtained Electronic Attestations of Attributes. This process ensures that the User retains control over their data, including the ability to present only the information strictly necessary for verification by Relying Parties. At the same time, it guarantees the reliability, authenticity, and validity of the data presented.

The Authentication process can be carried out using both the same-device and cross-device modes described above. For the User Experience functional requirements that MUST be addressed, please refer to the functional requirements for `remote presentation`_ in same-device and cross-device modes.

From a User Experience perspective, the Authentication process differs from the Presentation process only in how it is initiated, which is through a dedicated :ref:`Authentication Button`.

To ensure a consistent and seamless Authentication process across all Relying Parties, each Relying Party MUST follow the visual and User Experience requirements outlined below and SHOULD use the open-source assets available in the Official Resources.

Relying Parties that choose not to adopt these resources MAY implement custom Technical Solutions supporting the Authentication process. However, these MUST comply with the requirements specified below, adhere to [REF_ACCESSIBILITY], and, for public entities, follow the [GL_DESIGN].

Relying Parties MUST implement and provide the following pages as part of the Authentication process:

- **Discovery Page**: lists all the available Authentication methods;
- **QR Code page** (*cross-device only*): prompts the User to scan a QR code;
- **waiting page** (*cross-device only*): instructs the User to continue the Authentication process on their Wallet Instance;
- **thank you page**: confirms the successful Authentication;
- **error page**: displays error messages related to the Authentication process.

Each of these pages MUST include the following recurring elements, in line with the Visual Identity of the Relying Party’s Touchpoint:

- a **header and/or subheader** allowing Users to navigate back to the previous page.
- a **footer** including the privacy policy, legal notice, and accessibility statement, where required by current regulations.

Specific requirements for each individual page are detailed below.

**Discovery Page**

To enable authentication via the IT-Wallet System, the Relying Party MAY replace its existing Discovery Page with the version provided in the Official Resources.

Alternatively, the Relying Party MAY maintain its own Discovery Page but MUST integrate the Authentication Button as specified in the :ref:`Authentication Button` section.

In all cases:

- the page MUST display all available Digital Identity Authentication methods, including the IT-Wallet System Authentication through the Authentication Button;
- the page MAY also include other available Authentication methods;

The page SHOULD provide essential supporting information to help the User make an informed and conscious choice.

If the User accesses the Discovery Page from a different Touchpoint than the one where the Wallet Instance is activated (cross-device), selecting IT-Wallet System Authentication MUST redirect the User to the QR code page.

If the User accesses the Discovery Page from the same Touchpoint where the Wallet Instance is activated (same-device), the selection MUST trigger the opening of the User’s Wallet Instance.

**QR code page (cross-device only)**

The QR code page is presented to the User who selects IT-Wallet System Authentication within a cross-device process. Its purpose is to prompt the User to scan the generated QR code using their Wallet Instance.

Relying Parties SHOULD implement the QR code page (cross-device) provided in the Official Resources. In any case:

- the page MUST include the Visual Identity elements of the IT-Wallet System, including the logo;
- the page MUST display the QR code along with a clear and concise message instructing the User to scan it using their Wallet Instance;
- the page MUST indicate the validity period of the QR code with a short and clear message;
- the page MUST include a Call To Action allowing the User to generate a new QR code in case of timeout;
- the page MUST include a Call To Action allowing the User to cancel the operation and return to the Discovery Page.

To ensure QR code readability:

- minimum recommended dimensions MUST be respected to ensure successful scanning. A size of 150×150 pixels is generally sufficient; for high-density codes (e.g., long URLs or many characters), 300×300 pixels or larger is recommended;
- adequate contrast MUST be maintained between the QR code and the background (ideal: black code on a white background);
- color inversion between the QR code and the background MUST be avoided;
- only one QR code SHOULD be displayed per page;
- the QR code MUST be sharp and high-quality (SVG format is recommended);
- no text or other visual elements SHOULD overlap or obscure the QR code.

**Waiting page (cross-device only)**

The waiting page is shown after the QR code has been scanned and prompts the User to continue the Authentication process within their Wallet Instance.

Relying Parties SHOULD implement the waiting page (cross-device) provided in the Official Resources. In any case:

- the page MUST include visual identity elements of the IT-Wallet System, including the logo and an icon or graphical element that reinforces the page message;
- the page MUST include a clear and concise message instructing the User to continue the process on their Wallet Instance.

**Thank you page**

The thank you page is displayed after the User completes the Authentication process via their Wallet Instance. Its purpose is to prompt the User to proceed to the authenticated area of the Relying Party’s Touchpoint.

Relying Parties SHOULD implement the thank you page provided in the Official  Resources. In any case:

- the page MUST include the visual identity elements of the IT-Wallet System, including the logo and an icon or graphical element that reinforces the page message;
- the page MUST provide a clear and concise message confirming that the authentication process was successfully completed;
- the page MUST include a Call To Action prompting the User to proceed to the Touchpoint authenticated area.

**Error page**

The error page is displayed when an issue occurs during the Authentication process. Its purpose is to inform the User about the nature of the error (e.g., technical issue, network issues, Wallet Instance malfunction, denied data sharing, etc.) and to present the available next steps. For further details, refer to the `Error Management`_ section.

Relying Parties SHOULD implement the error page provided in the Official Resources. In any case:

- the page MUST include the visual identity elements of the IT-Wallet System, including the logo and an icon or graphical element that conveys the type of error;
- the page MUST include a clear and concise message explaining the nature of the error, the error code, and a simple description;
- the page MUST include one or more Call To Action guiding the User toward the appropriate next step (e.g., retry, contact support, etc.).

Management of Electronic Attestations
**************************************

The Wallet Provider, via their Wallet Solution, and the PID provider or Electronic Attestations of Attributes Provider, via dedicated Touchpoints, MUST let the User  manage their Electronic Attestations at any time.

This section outlines three different categories of requirements for managing each Electronic Attestations, specifically regarding:

- **Its status**: to allow the User to verify whether an Electronic Attestation is valid or invalid;
- **Its usage**: to enable the User to view and manage the history of presentations carried out with an Electronic Attestation;
- **Its data**: to allow the User to backup and restore each Electronic Attestation of Attributes in compliance with the principle of data portability.

Below are the key aspects that impact and define the User Experience in managing Electronic Attestations though the Wallet Instance, along with the functional requirements associated with each category.

Status of Electronic Attestations
==================================

To ensure reliability and promote the proper use of a Wallet Solution, the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee the User to always have visibility of the status of the Electronic Attestations stored within their Wallet Instance, based on the information received from the Electronic Attestation Provider, which manages their lifecycle.

Each Electronic Attestation can be either valid or invalid, with corresponding impacts on its usage opportunities:

- **Valid**: Valid Electronic Attestations MUST be usable and therefore presentable. This category also includes Electronic Attestations that are nearing expiration.  If an Electronic Attestation is about to expire, the Wallet Instance SHOULD inform the User with adequate advance notice to allow sufficient time to request its reissuance or, if necessary, revoke it.

- **Invalid**: Invalid Electronic Attestations MUST NOT be usable or presentable. This category includes expired or revoked Electronic Attestations.  In such cases, the Wallet Instance MUST inform the User of the invalid status and SHOULD give the reason why. If an Electronic Attestation is no longer valid and cannot be used in any scenario, the Wallet Solution MAY implement mechanisms to restrict access to the Detailed View of that Electronic Attestation. This is intended to encourage the User to update or delete the Electronic Attestation by providing appropriate informational text and a Call to Action.

Revocation of Electronic Attestations
................................................................

Revocation is the procedure that turns an Electronic Attestation from a valid state to an invalid state. Revocation can occur in either an active or passive mode:

- **Active revocation**: This refers to the revocation of an Electronic Attestation at the User’s request. This process affects only the Electronic Attestation and not its corresponding physical document, if one exists. Below is an illustrative list of scenarios in which the Wallet Provider MUST give the User the ability to request the revocation of an Electronic Attestation:

	- The User decides they no longer wish to use a specific Electronic Attestation;
	- The User decides to deactivate their Wallet Instance, thereby revoking all previously obtained Electronic Attestations;
	- The User no longer has possession of the device on which their Wallet Instance is installed due to loss or theft.

- **Passive revocation**: This refers to the revocation of an Electronic Attestation managed by the respective Electronic Attestation Provider on behalf of the Authentic Source. In this case, the Wallet Instance MUST inform the User of the status change of the Electronic Attestation  and the Electronic Attestation Provider MAY additionally notify the User  via other Touchpoints . Below is an illustrative list of scenarios that could lead to the revocation of an Electronic Attestation:

	- The physical document corresponding to the Electronic Attestation has been reported lost or damaged by the User through the appropriate channel/ Touchpoint;
	- The physical document corresponding to the Electronic Attestation has been revoked by the competent authorities;
	- The minimum security and/ or reliability requirements for one or more involved parties are no longer met.
	- The User's device no longer meets the minimum security requirements (rooted or jailbroken).


History of Electronic Attestations
===================================

To ensure the principles of visibility and transparency, the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee the User to view the history of all Electronic Attestations presentations performed using their Wallet Instance. In particular:

- the Wallet Instance MUST show the User see which Relying Party they have interacted with and which Electronic Attestations have been presented and verified;
- the Wallet Instance MUST allow the User to easily request the Relying Party to delete their information related to previous presentations.


Backup and Restore of Electronic Attestation of Attributes
===========================================================

With the aim of ensuring the principle of data portability, the Wallet Solution MUST guarantee the User to have access to specific functionalities, particularly to:

- Request the backup and storage of Electronic Attestations of Attributes obtained through their Wallet Instance;
- Request the restore of their Electronic Attestations of Attributes on another Wallet Instance.


Deactivation of the Wallet Instance
************************************

The deactivation of the Wallet Instance is the functionality that makes the Wallet Instance inactive and therefore no longer operational. The deactivation process can be triggered by different actors depending on the circumstances, specifically:

- By the User, in cases such as:

	- The device has been lost or stolen;
	- The device has been compromised;
	- The device has been reset to factory settings.

- By an authorized third party, in cases such as:

	- The Wallet Solution no longer meets the minimum security requirements.

The Wallet Provider MUST guarantee the User the ability to voluntarily deactivate their Wallet Instance through:

- The Wallet Instance itself;
- A Touchpoint (e.g., a website) provided by the Wallet Provider;
- The device’s app store, by uninstalling the Wallet Instance.

Below are the functional and User Experience requirements that the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee via their Wallet Solution:

- the User accesses their Wallet Instance using the previously configured unlock method or Authenticates at the Touchpoint provided by the Wallet Provider;
- the User selects the Wallet Instance deactivation functionality;
- the User is informed that deactivating the Wallet Instance will invalidate previously obtained Electronic Attestations;
- the User confirms the action to proceed with deactivation, or cancels the operation;
- the User receives confirmation of successful deactivation;
- the User is notified that the Wallet Instance is inactive when logging in again;
- the User has the ability to reactivate the Wallet Instance by re-downloading the app from the app store (if uninstalled) and/or by following the activation process again. For further details, please refer to the `Activation of the Wallet Instance`_ section.

Once the Wallet Instance is reactivated, Electronic Attestations of Attributes can be re-obtained by starting the issuance or restore process again. For more details, please refer to sections `Issuance of Electronic Attestations of Attributes`_ and `Backup and Restore of Electronic Attestation of Attributes`_.

In case of errors using the Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee that the User receives consistent messages that inform them and guide them toward resolving the issue. For more details, please refer to the `Error Management`_ section.


Error Management
*****************

The IT-Wallet System involves the interaction of multiple services provided by different actors. It is therefore important to define an effective error management model with the goal of improving the perception and reliability of the entire ecosystem and enabling the User to feel guided during interactions with the various Technical Solutions and to and to consciously manage any issues while using the service.

Effective communication in case of an error also provides benefits for the actors involved, as it contributes to the reduction of assistance requests and, thus, to the minimisation of the impact on support systems.

Below are the requirements and main best practices for error management, specifically related to the interaction between the User and their Wallet Instance. All Primary Actors involved in providing the service MUST cooperate to enable the User to receive timely and granular inputs through their Wallet Instance, each within their scope of responsibility. Each actor involved MUST, therefore, define a list of errors so as to ensure that the Wallet Provider can prepare an effective model for their management within the Wallet Solution considering the following dimensions and variables:

- **The stage of the User Experience** where the error may occur: activation or deactivation of the Wallet Instance, obtaining, presenting, or managing Electronic Attestations of Attributes;
- **The type of error**: system error, communication error between actors, etc.;
- **The actor responsible** for the error: Wallet Provider, PID Provider, Electronic Attestations of Attributes Provider, Authentic Source;
- **The way the error is displayed**: message on the page, banner, toast message, and so on;
- **Suggested actions for the User** to resolve the error: suggestion to wait, request to try again, referral to FAQs and/or customer care, etc.;
- **The method for error management**: opening an assistance request through the Wallet Instance, linking to other detailed channels, and so on. For further details, please refer to the :ref:`User Assistance` section.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of the main error cases, with reference to the actor responsible for their management, for each phase of the User Experience.

In addition to error management, all Primary Actors MUST also deal with negative feedback resulting from the User’s decision to abandon or cancel a flow (e.g. Activation, Acquisition, Presentation, etc.). In such cases, feedback MUST be provided to confirm the User’s choice, and it MAY include a Call to Action to continue.

User Assistance
********************************

For effective error management and the resolution of any other issues, Primary Actors MUST ensure adequate support to the User by structuring a simple and effective assistance model based on the following principles:

- **Self-resolution**: to allow the User to consult the frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the content and functionalities of the Wallet Instance, in order to resolve any error cases or issues independently.

- **Guided issue reporting**: to guide the User through the process of opening an assistance ticket, in order to clearly define the issue and facilitate its resolution.

- **Collaboration between actors**: to allow the coordination among each actor involved (Wallet Provider, Electronic Attestations of Attributes Provider, PID Provider, and Authentic Source), according to their specific roles and operational procedures.

- **Efficient communication**: to allow the User to track the updated status of their request throughout all stages of processing, with clear, continuous, and coordinated communication.

To implement these best practices, the Wallet Provider SHOULD establish a hierarchical assistance model:

	1. **Level I | Self-management**: the Wallet Provider SHOULD allow the User to access to a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section within their Wallet Instance to clarify doubts and resolve certain issues independently. Each actor SHOULD create specific FAQs and corresponding answers regarding the data and functionalities they provide to the Wallet Provider or in their Touchpoints. For certain error cases, the Wallet Provider SHOULD provide another actor's direct channel of support to facilitate timely management and avoid opening an assistance request within the Wallet Instance.

	2. **Level II | Requesting assistance** from the Wallet Provider: if Level I is insufficient, the Wallet Provider MUST give the User the possibility to open one or more assistance requests. These requests SHOULD be managed through the Wallet Instance or other Wallet Provider Touchpoints. The Wallet Provider MUST diagnose and resolve the issue if it falls under their responsibility.

	3. **Level III | Forwarding the request to the responsible actor**: if Level II is insufficient, the Wallet Provider SHOULD ensure that the request is forwarded to the responsible actor (Electronic Attestations of Attributes Provider, PID Provider, or Authentic Source), who MUST ensure the availability of dedicated back-office channels to resolve the issue and communicate the outcome to the User.

Here are the functional and User Experience requirements that the Wallet Provider MUST guarantee via their Wallet Solution:

- the User accesses to assistance options at any point during the User Experience, with a clear indication of how to access them;
- the User opens an assistance request through their Wallet Instance or other Touchpoints provided by the Wallet Provider;
- when a support request is open, the User receives prompt confirmation that the request has been acknowledged;
- the User is informed in advance if it is necessary to present their data with third parties;
- the User is informed when an assistance request needs to be managed outside of their Wallet Instance, such as on third-party channels;
- the User tracks the status of the request at any time through functionalities that MUST be made available by the actors dealing with the request.

User Feedback
********************************

User feedback collection allows for monitoring the User Experience, identifying potential areas for optimization, and continuously measuring the effectiveness of the service. Each Wallet Provider SHOULD establish a structured feedback collection system to monitor and improve the User Experience.

This feedback system MAY be fed by two different types of feedback collection:

- **Transactional Feedback** (Customer Effort Score, Customer Satisfaction): collected in response to specific actions, such as adding an Electronic Attestation or completing a presentation and verification process;
- **Relational Feedback** (Net Promoter Score): not in connection with specific actions, collected to measure the overall perception of the User in terms of satisfaction, loyalty, and likelihood of recommending the service to third-party users.

Here are some suggestions for implementing these types of feedback tools:

**Transactional Feedback Collection**

- **Customer Effort Score (CES)**: To measure the ease of use of the functionalities, surveys MAY be provided, for example, through components like modals or pop-ups within the Wallet Instance, triggered at the conclusion of specific actions or processes. Examples include:

	- After completing the process of obtaining an Electronic Attestation;
	- After the Authentication process, if positive;
	- After the presentation process, particularly at the end of the first presentation opportunity and no more than once every 6 months;
	- After the revocation and deactivation processes, to explore the reasons behind these actions.

- **Customer Satisfaction Survey (CSAT)**: To measure the overall satisfaction of the User after a prolonged period of using the Wallet Instance, surveys MAY be provided, for example, through modals or pop-ups within the Wallet Instance. It is recommended to use the CSAT at intervals of no less than six months and as an alternative to CES, to avoid overwhelming Users with too frequent surveys.

**Relational Feedback Collection**

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: To measure User loyalty and the likelihood of recommending the service to others, an evaluation MAY be requested from the User once or twice a year, either through the same service delivery channel (e.g. the Wallet Instance) or external channels such as email or SMS. This should be aligned with the overall feedback collection strategy.
