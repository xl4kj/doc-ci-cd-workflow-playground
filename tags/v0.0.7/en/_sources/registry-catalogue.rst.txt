Digital Credentials Catalogue
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Digital Credentials Catalogue is the registry of all available Digital Credentials recognized within the IT-Wallet ecosystem. It is published by the Trust Anchor and publicly available by all Entities through a specialized Federation endpoint. It acts as a single reference point for all actors involved in the process of issuing, verifying and using Digital Credentials.

The Digital Credential Catalogue aims to:

  1. Facilitate Digital Credential discovery for Users.
  2. Standardize the technical and functional description of Digital Credentials.
  3. Enable interoperability between different Issuers and Relying Parties.
  4. Simplify the integration process for Wallet Providers and Relying Parties.
  5. Ensure trust in the ecosystem through certified information.
  6. Provide transparency on the ecosystem of available Digital Credentials.


The main Entities involved in the Digital Credential Catalogue are:

  - **Trust Anchor**: It manages and maintains the Digital Credential Catalogue, guaranteeing its authenticity and integrity.
  - **Supervisory Body**: It interacts with the Trust Anchor and the Digital Credential Catalogue to monitor the registration phase ensuring security and privacy according to national/European regulations, keeping all the information reliable and updated.
  - **Digital Credential Issuers**: The entities authorized to issue Digital Credentials, registering them in the Catalogue.
  - **Relying Parties**: They use the Digital Credential Catalogue to gather all the information needed about the Digital Credentials they intend to request during the presentation phase.
  - **Wallet Providers**: They access the Digital Credential Catalogue to identify the available Digital Credentials and to retrieve all necessary information for integrating them into their Wallet Solutions.
  - **Users**: The citizens who indirectly use the Digital Credentials Catalogue through their Wallet Instances to discover and request Digital Credentials.
  - **Authentic Sources**: The Entities that hold the original data that is attested in the Digital Credentials. They provide support to Issuers in registering the Digital Credentials in the Catalogue.

The corresponding example of Digital Credentials Catalogue as decoded in JSON for both header and payload is the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/catalogue-example-header.json
  :language: JSON

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/catalogue-example-payload.json
  :language: JSON

.. note::
  For a better and more efficient management of the localisation of the information contained in the Digital Credentials Catalogue, an Entity consulting it SHOULD:

    - Download the basic version of the Digital Credentials Catalogue (compact, without localisations) using the ``.well-known/credential-catalogue`` endpoint.
    - Determine the User's preferred language.
    - Download only the necessary localisation bundles.
    - Dynamically merge localised content with the Digital Credentials Catalogue structure.

  A non-normative example of a localisation bundle output is given below:

    .. code-block::

      {
        "driving_license.name": "Patente di Guida",
        "driving_license.description": "Patente di guida ufficiale valida in Italia e nell'UE",
        "purpose.driving_authorization.name": "Abilitazione alla guida",
        "purpose.driving_authorization.description": "Verifica di Abilitazione alla guida",
        "claims.given_name.name": "Nome",
        ...
      }

  Localization bundles MUST be available at the URI specified in the **localization_info.bundles_base_uri** claim of the Digital Credentials Catalogue. Each locale bundle MUST be accessible following the naming pattern **{locale_code}.json**, where **{locale_code}** is replaced with the corresponding locale code from the **available_locales** array.

  A non-normative example of the Italian localization URI for the mDL bundle would be **https://trust-registry.eid-wallet.example.it/.well-known/l10n/mdl/it.json**.

  Entities SHOULD verify the integrity of downloaded localization bundles using the digest method and values specified in the **localization_info.integrity** claim. This ensures that the localization data has not been tampered with during transmission.


Claims Taxonomy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Digital Credential Catalogue, MUST include also a reference URI to Claim Taxonomy providing, in a single resource, the semantic information of all registered and available claims within the IT-Wallet ecosystem. It MUST be Credential format neutral and has the aim of facilitating Digital Credentials integrations in the IT-Wallet technical solutions.

A non-normative example of the Claim Taxonomy is given below.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/catalogue-claims-taxonomy.json
  :language: JSON


Digital Credentials Catalogue Endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Digital Credentials Catalogue Endpoint MUST be a well-known HTTPS URI [:rfc:`8615`] that provides public access to information related to the Credentials available in IT-Wallet.

Digital Credentials Catalogue Request
---------------------------------------

The Digital Credentials Catalogue Request MUST be an HTTP GET using the application/jose media type as in the following non-normative example.

.. code-block:: http

    GET /.well-known/credential-catalogue HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.trust-registry.eid-wallet.example.it
    Content-Type: application/jose

.. note:: As a future enhancement, the Trust Anchor MAY implement a dynamic endpoint that enables filtering credentials by type, while offering pagination capabilities, to support more efficient and flexible browsing of the Digital Credentials Catalogue.


Digital Credentials Catalogue Response
----------------------------------------

The Digital Credentials Catalogue Response MUST be a JWS that contains the parameters listed in the :ref:`table of Digital Credentials Catalogue parameters <table_catalogue_parameters>`.

A non-normative example of the response is provided below.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/catalogue-example-jws.txt
  :language: text
