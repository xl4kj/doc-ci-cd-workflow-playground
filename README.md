## Intro

This repository hosts the IT-Wallet Technical Specifications: the technical architecture, implementation framework and design requirements to be adopoted by the IT-Wallet System Technical Solutions.

For more information on the IT-Wallet System please refer to the [official page]([url](https://innovazione.gov.it/progetti/sistema-it-wallet/)).

The repository is structured as sphinx project tree. **The first stable release is v1.0**; other contents in the repository may be considered experimental.


## Versioning and preview

This project adheres to the [*Semantic
Versioning*](https://semver.org/) model.

Furthermore, this project uses the git *branches* and *tags* in the following way:
* the branch `versione-corrente` contains the last stable version of the standard;
* The [release page](https://github.com/italia/eid-wallet-it-docs/releases) of
  GitHub contains all the released versions of the specifications. For the sake of coherence, the *releases* are made according to the tag names.

Each time a release is created or edited, a preview is built based on the tag the release refers to. 
A preview of the latest editor's copy build, corresponding to the branch `versione-corrente` can be navigated using the following link:

 - [Editor's Copy](https://italia.github.io/eid-wallet-it-docs/versione-corrente/en/)
