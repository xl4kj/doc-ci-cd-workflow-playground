    PID Issuance - General architecture and high level flow.

The high-level flow begins with the User who wants to obtain a PID and starts his/her Wallet Instance (Step 0). Below the description of the steps represented in the previous picture:

    1. **PID Provider Discovery and Trust**: the Wallet Instance discovers the trusted PID Provider using the Digital Credential Catalogue and Federation Services, establishing the trust to the PID Provider according to the Trust Model and obtaining its metadata that discloses the formats of the PID, the algorithms supported, and any other parameter required for interoperability needs.
    2. **PID Request**: using the Authorization Code Flow defined in [`OpenID4VCI`_] the Wallet Instance requests the PID to the PID Provider.
    3. **Wallet Provider Discovery and Trust**: the PID Provider checks the authenticity and validity of the Wallet Instance, establishing the trust to the Wallet Provider and obtaining Wallet metadata with the parameters required for interoperability needs, according to the Trust Model.
    4. **User Authentication**: the PID Provider authenticates the User with CieID LoA High (L3), acting as an Identity and Access Management Proxy to the National eID system.
    5. **Fetch of PID data from National Public Registry**: the PID Provider obtains the required PID data from National Public Registry (ANPR) which acts as Authentic Source.
    6. **PID Issuance**: the PID Provider releases a PID bound to the key material held by the requesting Wallet Instance.

High-Level (Q)EAA flow
----------------------

The :numref:`fig_High-Level-Flow-ITWallet-QEAA-Issuance` shows a general architecture and highlights the main operations involved in the issuance of a (Q)EAA, following the assumptions listed below:

  - the User has a valid PID stored in their own Wallet Instance;
  - the (Q)EAA requires a high security implementation profile.

    (Q)EAA Issuance - General architecture and high level flow

Similarly to the PID high-level flow, the above diagram depicts a (Q)EAA high-level flow starting from the User who wants to obtain a (Q)EAA (step 0). Below the description of the most relevant operations involved in the (Q)EAA issuance:

    1. **(Q)EAA Provider Discovery and Trust**: the Wallet Instance obtains the list of the trusted (Q)EAA Providers using the Digital Credential Catalogue and Federation API (e.g.: using the Subordinate Listing Endpoint of the Trust Anchor and its Intermediates), then inspects the metadata looking for the Digital Credential capabilities of each (Q)EAA Provider.
    2. **(Q)EAA Request**: using the Authorization Code Flow, defined in [`OpenID4VCI`_], the Wallet Instance requests a (Q)EAA to the (Q)EAA Provider.
    3. **Wallet Provider Discovery and Trust**: the (Q)EAA Provider verifies the authenticity and validity of the Wallet Instance. During this step the (Q)EAA Provider establishes trust with the Wallet Provider and retrieves Wallet metadata containing the necessary parameters for interoperability, as defined by the Trust Model.
    4. **User Authentication**: the (Q)EAA Provider, acting as a Relying Party Instance, authenticates the User evaluating the presentation of the PID.
    5. **Obtaining Attributes**: the (Q)EAA Provider fetches User attributes from the relevant Authentic Source.
    6. **(Q)EAA Issuance**: the (Q)EAA Provider releases a (Q)EAA bound to the key material held by the requesting Wallet Instance.


Low-Level Issuance Flow
-----------------------

The PID/(Q)EAA Issuance flow is based on [`OpenID4VCI`_] and the following main reference standards/specifications MUST be supported on top of `OpenID4VCI`_:

  * **The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework** [:rfc:`6749`], as recommended in Section 3 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].
  * **Pushed Authorization Requests** (PAR) [:rfc:`9126`], as recommended in Section 5 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].
  * **Proof Key for Code Exchange** (PKCE)  [:rfc:`7636`], as recommended in Section 5 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].
  * **JWT Authorization Requests** (JAR) [:rfc:`9101`].
  * **JWT Authorization Response Modes** (JARM) [`JARM`_].
  * **Rich Authorization Requests** (RAR) [:rfc:`9396`].
  * **OAuth 2.0 Attestation-Based Client Authentication** [`OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_].
  * **OpenID Federation 1.0** [`OID-FED`_].

The PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST use *OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server* based on :rfc:`6749` to authorize the User to obtain a Credential. PID/(Q)EAA Providers MUST support:

  * **Authorization Code Flow**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider requires User authentication and consent at the Authorization Endpoint before collecting User information to create and provide a Credential.
  * **Wallet Initiated Flow**: The request from the Wallet Instance is sent to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider without any input from the PID/(Q)EAA Provider.
  * **Immediate Issuance flow**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider issues the Credential directly in response to the Credential Request.

In addition, the PID/(Q)EAA Providers MAY support:

  * **Issuer Initiated Flow**: The Wallet Instance sends its request to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider based on the input provided by the PID/(Q)EAA Provider.

    * **Same-device Issuance flow**: The User receives the Credential on the same device used to initiate the flow.
    * **Cross-device Issuance flow**: The User receives the Credential on another device than the one that initiated the flow.

  * **Refresh Token flow**: The Wallet Instance requests a new Access Token at the Token Endpoint of the PID/(Q)EEA.
  * **Re-issuance flow**: Following updates to an already stored Digital Credential, the Wallet Instance requests a refresh of the Digital Credential at the Credential Endpoint of the PID/(Q)EAA Provider.
  * **Deferred Issuance flow**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider may require time to issue the requested Digital Credential, due to the Authentic Sources data provisioning rules, and allows the Wallet to retrieve the requested Credential in the future.

The entire Issuance flow can be divided into two sub-flows:

  - **User Request flow**, describing the modes through which the User can request the Credential. It can be:

      **1)** On the initiative of the User (**Wallet Initiated**)

      **2)** Upon proposal of the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer (**Issuer Initiated**)

  - **Issuance flow**, describing interactions between Wallet Instance and PID/(Q)EAA Provider.

The following diagram shows the *User request flow*.

**Steps 1.1-1.4 (Wallet Initiated Flow):** The User, using the Wallet Instance, selects the PID/(Q)EAA Provider from those listed in the list of trustworthy entities.

**Steps 2.1-2.3 (Issuer Initiated Flow):** The User while browsing the PID/(Q)EAA Provider website finds a link to obtain a Digital Credential.

**Steps 2.4-2.7 (Cross-Device):** The Credential Offer is presented as a QR Code displayed to the User. The User scans the QR Code using the Wallet Instance which retrieves the parameters defined in the :ref:`Table of Credential Offer parameters <table_credential_offer_claim>`.

**Steps 2.8-2.10 (Same-Device):** The Credential Offer is presented as an href button containing the URL that allows the User to invoke the Wallet Instance using the Credential Offer Endpoint.

Below a non-normative example of a URL related to a Credential Offer that can be included in a QR Code or in html page with an href button:

    PID/(Q)EAA Issuance - Detailed flow


Once *User Request flow* is completed, the Wallet Instance processes the Metadata of the PID/(Q)EAA Provider as defined in Section :ref:`Trust Evaluation Mechanism <Trust Evaluation Mechanism>` .

.. note::

    **Federation Check:** The Wallet Instance must verify whether the PID/(Q)EAA Provider is a member of the Federation, obtaining its protocol specific Metadata. A non-normative example of a response from the endpoint **.well-known/openid-federation** with the **Entity Configuration** and the **Metadata** of the PID/(Q)EAA Provider is represented within the section :ref:`Entity Configuration of PID/(Q)EAA Providers`.

In case of Issuer Initiated flow, in addition to the Federation Check defined above, the Wallet Instance MUST execute the following checks on the Credential Offer parameters:

  * For each Credential identifier contained in the ``credential_configuration_ids`` array verify if it is supported by the PID/(Q)EAA Provider.
  * The Authorization Server identifier (if present) is contained in the ``authorization_servers`` PID/(Q)EAA Provider metadata parameter.


**Steps 1-2 (PAR Request)**: The Wallet Instance:

  * creates a fresh PKCE code verifier, Wallet Attestation Proof of Possession, and ``state`` parameter for the *Pushed Authorization Request*.
  * provides to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider PAR endpoint the parameters previously listed above, using the ``request`` parameter (hereafter Request Object) according to :rfc:`9126` Section 3 to prevent Request URI swapping attack. The Pushed Authorization Request enables client authentication prior to any user interaction. This step allows for the early rejection of illegitimate requests, effectively preventing spoofing attacks, tampering, and improper use of authorization requests.
  * MUST create the ``code_verifier`` with enough entropy random string using the unreserved characters with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters, making it impractical for an attacker to guess its value. The value MUST be generated following the recommendation in Section 4.1 of :rfc:`7636`.
  * signs this request using the private key that is created during the setup phase to obtain the Wallet Attestation. The related public key that is attested by the Wallet Provider is provided within the Wallet Attestation ``cnf.jwk`` claim.
  * MUST use the ``OAuth-Client-Attestation`` and  ``OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP`` parameters according to OAuth 2.0 Attestation-based Client Authentication [`OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_], since in this flow the Pushed Authorization Endpoint is a protected endpoint.
  * specifies the types of the requested credentials using the ``authorization_details`` [RAR :rfc:`9396`] parameter and or scope parameter.

.. _par_request_reqs:

The PID/(Q)EAA Provider performs the following checks upon the receipt of the PAR request:

    1. It MUST validate the signature of the Request Object using the algorithm specified in the ``alg`` header parameter (:rfc:`9126`, :rfc:`9101`) and the public key retrieved from the Wallet Attestation (``cnf.jwk``) referenced in the Request Object, using the ``kid`` JWT header parameter.
    2. It MUST check that the used algorithm for signing the request in the ``alg`` header is one of the listed within the Section `Cryptographic Algorithms <algorithms.html>`_.
    3. It MUST check that the ``client_id`` in the request body of the PAR request matches the ``client_id`` claim included in the Request Object.
    4. It MUST check that the ``iss`` claim in the Request Object matches the ``client_id`` claim in the Request Object (:rfc:`9126`, :rfc:`9101`).
    5. It MUST check that the ``aud`` claim in the Request Object is equal to the identifier of the PID/(Q)EAA Provider (:rfc:`9126`, :rfc:`9101`).
    6. It MUST reject the PAR request, if it contains the ``request_uri`` parameter (:rfc:`9126`).
    7. It MUST check that the Request Object contains all the mandatory parameters which values are validated according to :ref:`Table of the HTTP parameters <table_request_object_claim>` [derived from :rfc:`9126`].
    8. It MUST check that the Request Object is not expired, checking the ``exp`` claim.
    9. It MUST check that the Request Object was issued in a previous time than the value exposed in the ``iat`` claim. It SHOULD reject the request if the ``iat`` claim is far from the current time (:rfc:`9126`) of more than `5` minutes.
    10. It MUST check that the ``jti`` claim in the Request Object has not been used before by the Wallet Instance identified by the ``client_id``. This allows the PID/(Q)EAA Provider to mitigate replay attacks (:rfc:`7519`).
    11. It MUST validate the ``OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP`` parameter based on Section 4 of [`OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_].

.. note::

    **Federation Check**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST check that the Wallet Provider is part of the federation.


.. note::
   The PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST validate the signature of the the Wallet Attestation and that it is not expired.


**Step 3 (PAR Response)**:  The PID/(Q)EAA Provider provides a one-time use ``request_uri`` value. The issued ``request_uri`` value MUST be bound to the client identifier (``client_id``) that was provided in the Request Object.


.. note::
    The entropy of the ``request_uri`` MUST be sufficiently large. The adequate shortness of the validity and the entropy of the ``request_uri`` depends on the risk calculation based on the value of the resource being protected. The validity time SHOULD be less than a minute, and the ``request_uri`` MUST include a cryptographic random value of 128 bits or more (:rfc:`9101`). The entire ``request_uri`` SHOULD NOT exceed 512 ASCII characters due to the following two main reasons (:rfc:`9101`):

        1. Many phones on the market still do not accept large payloads. The restriction is typically either 512 or 1024 ASCII characters.
        2. On a slow connection such as a 2G mobile connection, a large URL would cause a slow response; therefore, the use of such is not advisable from the user-experience point of view.

The PID/(Q)EAA Provider returns the issued ``request_uri`` to the Wallet Instance. A non-normative example of the response is shown below.

.. _iss_authz_request_reqs:

**Steps 4-5 (Authorization Request)**: The Wallet Instance sends an authorization request to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider Authorization Endpoint. Since parts of this Authorization Request content, e.g., the ``code_challenge`` parameter value, are unique to a particular Authorization Request, the Wallet Instance MUST use a ``request_uri`` value once (:rfc:`9126`); The  PID/(Q)EAA Provider performs the following checks upon the receipt of the Authorization Request:

    1. It MUST treat ``request_uri`` values as one-time use and MUST reject an expired request. However, it MAY allow for duplicate requests due to a User reloading/refreshing their user-agent (derived from :rfc:`9126`).
    2. It MUST identify the request as a result of the submitted PAR (derived from :rfc:`9126`).
    3. It MUST reject all the Authorization Requests that do not contain the ``request_uri`` parameter as the PAR is the only way to pass the Authorization Request from the Wallet Instance (derived from :rfc:`9126`).


.. code-block:: http

    GET /authorize?client_id=$thumprint-of-the-jwk-in-the-cnf-wallet-attestation$&request_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Arequest_uri%3Abwc4JK-ESC0w8acc191e-Y1LTC2 HTTP/1.1
    Host: eaa-provider.example.org


.. note::

   **User Authentication and Consent**: The PID Provider performs the User authentication based on CieID scheme with LoA High (CIE L3) and requires the User consent for the PID issuance.
   The (Q)EAA Provider performs the User authentication requesting a valid PID to the Wallet Instance. The (Q)EAA Provider MUST use [`OpenID4VP`_] to request the presentation of the PID. In this circumstance, the (Q)EAA Provider acts as a Relying Party, providing the presentation request to the Wallet Instance. The Wallet Instance MUST have a valid PID, obtained beforehand, to initiate the transaction with the (Q)EAA Provider. During this step, PID/(Q)EAA Providers MAY ask the User's contact details (e.g., their email address) to send notifications about the issued Digital Credential(s).



**Steps 6-7 (Authorization Response)**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider sends an authorization ``code`` together with ``state`` and ``iss`` parameters to the Wallet Instance. The Wallet Instance performs the following checks on the Authorization Response:

    1. It MUST check the Authorization Response contains all the defined parameters according to :ref:`Table of the HTTP Response parameters <table_http_response_claim>`.
    2. It MUST check the returned value by the PID/(Q)EAA Provider for ``state`` parameter is equal to the value sent by Wallet Instance in the Request Object (:rfc:`6749`).
    3. It MUST check that the URL of PID/(Q)EAA Provider in ``iss`` parameter is equal to the URL identifier of intended PID/(Q)EAA Provider that the Wallet Instance start the communication with (:rfc:`9027`).

.. note::

    The Wallet Instance redirect URI is a universal or app link registered with the local operating system, so this latter will resolve it and pass the response to the Wallet Instance.

**Steps 8-9 (DPoP Proof for Token Endpoint)**: The Wallet Instance MUST create a new key pair for the DPoP and a fresh DPoP Proof JWT following the instruction provided in  the Section 4 of (:rfc:`9449`) for the token request to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider. The DPoP Proof JWT is signed using the private key for DPoP created by Wallet Instance for this scope. DPoP binds the Access Token, and optionally the Refresh Token, to a certain Wallet Instance (:rfc:`9449`) and mitigates the misuse of leaked or stolen tokens at the Credential Endpoint.

.. _iss_token_request_reqs:

**Step 10 (Token Request):** The Wallet Instance sends a token request to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider Token Endpoint with a *DPoP Proof JWT* and the parameters: ``code``, ``code_verifier``, and OAuth 2.0 Attestation based Client Authentication  (``OAuth-Client-Attestation`` and ``OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP``).
The ``OAuth-Client-Attestation`` is signed using the private key bound to the Wallet Instance. The related public key that is attested by the Wallet Provider is provided within the Wallet Attestation (``cnf.jwk`` claim). The PID/(Q)EAA Provider performs the following checks on the Token Request:

   1. It MUST ensure that the Authorization ``code`` is issued to the authenticated Wallet Instance (:rfc:`6749`) and was not replied.
   2. It MUST ensure the Authorization ``code`` is valid and has not been previously used (:rfc:`6749`).
   3. It MUST ensure the ``redirect_uri`` matches the value included in the previous Request Object (see Section 3.1.3.1. of [`OIDC`_]).
   4. It MUST validate the DPoP Proof JWT, according to (:rfc:`9449`) Section 4.3.

**Step 11 (Token Response)**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider validates the request. If successful, the Issuer provides the Wallet Instance with an Access Token and, optionally, a Refresh Token, both bound to the DPoP key.

  :language: JSON

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/rt-dpop-payload.json
  :language: JSON

**Step 12 (Nonce Request)**: According to Section 7.1 of [`OpenID4VCI`_], the Wallet Instance sends an HTTP POST request to the Nonce Endpoint to obtain a fresh ``c_nonce`` that can be used to create the proof of possession of key material for the subsequent request to the Credential Endpoint.

Below is a non-normative example of a Nonce Request:

.. code-block:: http

    POST /nonce HTTP/1.1
    Host: eaa-provider.example.org
    Content-Length: 0

**Step 13 (Nonce Response)**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider provides the `c_nonce` to the Wallet Instance. The parameter `c_nonce` is a string value, which MUST be unpredictable and is used later by the Wallet Instance in Step 16 to create the proof of possession of the key (*proof* claim) and it is the primary countermeasure against key proof replay attack.
Note that, the received `c_nonce` value can be used to create the proof as long as the Issuer
provides the Wallet Instance with a new `c_nonce` value.

Below is a non-normative example of a Nonce Response:

.. code-block:: http

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    Cache-Control: no-store

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/nonce-response.json
  :language: JSON


**Steps 14-15 (DPoP Proof for Credential Endpoint)**: The Wallet Instance for requesting the Digital Credential creates a proof of possession with ``c_nonce`` obtained in **Step 13** and using the private key used for the DPoP, signing a DPoP Proof JWT according to (:rfc:`9449`) Section 4. The ``jwk`` value in the ``proof`` parameter MUST be equal to the public key referenced in the DPoP.

.. _iss_cred_request_reqs:

**Step 16 (Credential Request)**: The Wallet Instance sends a request for the Digital Credential to the PID/(Q)EAA Credential endpoint. This request MUST include the Access Token, DPoP Proof JWT, credential type, proof (which demonstrates possession of the key). The proof parameter MUST be an object that contains evidence of possession of the cryptographic key material to which the issued PID/(Q)EAA Digital Credential will be bound. To verify the proof, the PID/(Q)EAA Provider conducts the following checks at the Credential endpoint:

 1. the JWT proof MUST include all required claims as specified in the table of Section :ref:`Token Request <sec_token_request>`;
 2. The key proof MUST be explicitly typed using header parameters as defined for the respective proof type;
 3. The header parameter alg MUST indicate a registered asymmetric digital signature algorithm, and MUST NOT be set to `none`;
 4. The signature on the key proof MUST be verified using the public key specified in the header parameter.
 5. The header parameter MUST NOT contain a private key.
 6. If a `c_nonce` value was previously provided by the server, the nonce claim in the JWT MUST match this `c_nonce` value. Furthermore, the creation time of the JWT, as indicated by the `iat` claim or a server-managed timestamp via the nonce claim, MUST be within an acceptable window of time as determined by the server.


.. note::

    **PID/(Q)EAA Credential Schema and Status registration**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST register all the issued Credentials for their later revocation, if needed.


.. note::

    It is RECOMMENDED that the public key contained in the ``jwt_proof`` be specifically generated for the requested Credential (fresh cryptographic key) to ensure that different issued Credentials do not share the same public key, thereby remaining unlinkable to each other.


A non-normative example of the Credential Request is provided below.

  :language: JSON

**Steps 17-21 (Credential Response)**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST validate the *DPoP JWT Proof* based on the steps defined in Section 4.3 of (:rfc:`9449`) and whether the *Access Token* is valid and suitable for the requested PID/(Q)EAA. The PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST validate the proof of possession for the key material the new Credential SHALL be bound to, according to `OpenID4VCI`_ Section 8.2.2. If all checks succeed, the PID/(Q)EAA Provider creates a new Credential bound to the key material and provides it to the Wallet Instance. The Wallet Instance MUST perform the following checks before proceeding with the secure storage of the PID/(Q)EAA:

    1. It MUST check that the PID/(Q)EAA Credential Response contains all the mandatory parameters and values are validated according to :ref:`Table of the Credential response parameters <table_credential_response_claim>`.
    2. It MUST check the PID/(Q)EAA integrity by verifying the signature using the algorithm specified in the ``alg`` header parameter of SD-JWT (:ref:`PID/(Q)EAA Data Model <pid_eaa_data_model.rst>`) and the public key that is identified using the ``kid`` header of the SD-JWT.
    3. It MUST check that the received PID/(Q)EAA (in credential claim) matches the requested credential type and complies with the specific schema of that Credential defined in :ref:`PID/(Q)EAA Data Model <pid_eaa_data_model.rst>`.
    4. It MUST process and verify the PID/(Q)EAA in SD-JWT VC format (according to `SD-JWT`_ Section 5.) or mdoc-CBOR format.
    5. It MUST verify the Trust Chain in the header of SD-JWT VC to verify that the PID/(Q)EAA Provider is trusted.

If the checks above are successful, the Wallet Instance requests the User's consent to store the Digital Credential. Upon receiving consent, the Wallet Instance securely stores the PID/(Q)EAA.

Below is a non-normative example of a successful response containing a Credential in SD-JWT VC format.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/mdoc-credential-response.json
  :language: JSON


.. note::

  If the requested Credential cannot be issued immediately and requires more time, the PID/(Q)EAA Provider SHOULD support the Deferred Flow (step 24) as specified in Section :ref:`Deferred Endpoint`.

**Step 22 (Notification Request)**: According to Section 10.1 of [`OpenID4VCI`_], the Wallet sends an HTTP POST request to the Notification Endpoint using the *application/json* media type as in the following non-normative example.

.. code-block:: http

  POST /notification HTTP/1.1

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/notification-request.json
  :language: JSON


**Step 23 (Notification Response)**: When the Credential Issuer has successfully received the Notification Request from the Wallet, it MUST respond with an HTTP status code *204* as recommended in Section 10.2 of [`OpenID4VCI`_]. Below is a non-normative example of response to a successful Notification Request:

.. code-block:: http

  HTTP/1.1 204 No Content


Refresh Token Flow
------------------

To use the the Deferred, Credential Request, and Notification endpoints, the Wallet Instance MUST present a valid DPoP Access Token to the Credential Issuer. However, when these endpoints are used in the Deferred Flow, for re-issuing or notifying the deletion of a Digital Credential, the Access Token might expire, as it is designed to be short-lived and these actions MAY occur days later. To address this, the specification RECOMMENDS the use of Refresh Tokens.

An Access Token obtained as a result of a Refresh Token flow MUST be limited to:

  - the Deferred endpoint to obtain a new Digital Credential after time set in the parameter ``lead_time`` or when it is notified as ready to be issued;
  - the Notification endpoint, to notify the deletion of a Digital Credential to the Credential Issuer;
  - the Credential endpoint, to refresh a Digital Credential that is already present in the Wallet Instance (also called Digital Credential re-issuance, see section :ref:`Re-Issuance Flow <Re-Issuance Flow>`).

To mitigate the impact of a stolen Refresh Token, the Refresh Tokens MUST be DPoP. These aspects are detailed and discussed in section :ref:`Security Considerations <Security Considerations>`.

Figure below shows how to obtain a new DPoP Access Token and a new DPoP Refresh Token to the Token Endpoint.

    Refresh Token Flow

.. note::
  The refresh of a Token may be triggered by different actions (e.g., User deletion of a Digital Credential). In each case, Wallet Instances are supposed to be running and the corresponding cryptographic material unlocked.

**Step 1.** The Wallet Instance MUST create a fresh DPoP Proof JWT and a fresh Wallet Attestation proof of possession for the token request of the PID/(Q)EAA Provider.

**Step 2.** To refresh a DPoP-bound Access Token, the Wallet Instance sends a token request using the parameter ``grant_type`` set to ``refresh_token``, including the DPoP header and the OAuth Client Attestation headers.
A non-normative example of the token request for a DPoP Access Token using a Refresh Token is shown below.

**Step 3.** The PID/(Q)EAA Provider validates the request according to the following checks:

  - It MUST validate the OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP parameter based on Section 4 of [OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH].
  - It MUST validate the DPoP Proof JWT, according to (RFC 9449) Section 4.3.
  - It MUST check that the Refresh Token is not expired, not revoked and is bound to the same set of DPoP key as the ones used in the DPoP Proof JWT.

If the request checks are successful, the PID/(Q)EAA Provider generates a new Access Token and a new Refresh Token and these MUST be both bound to the DPoP key. Both the Access Token and the Refresh Token are then sent back to the Wallet Instance.

A non-normative example of a successful response is shown below.

.. code::

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json
  Cache-Control: no-store
  {
      "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJhdCtqd3QiLCJhbGciOiJFU..",
      "refresh_token": "eyC3fiLdCtqd3QiLCJhbGciOiCL3..",
      "token_type": "DPoP",
      "expires_in": 3600,
  }

If the Refresh Token is expired or invalid, the PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST issue an error, using the error type member set to ``invalid_grant``. Therefore, to obtain the Digital Credential an issuance flow authenticating the User is required, as defined in Section :ref:`Low-Level Issuance Flow <Low-Level Issuance Flow>`.


Security Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To mitigate the risks of Refresh Token compromise, the following protections are required:

  - **Confidentiality** of Refresh Tokens MUST be guaranteed in transit and storage.
  - **TLS-protected** connections MUST be used for token transmission.
  - Refresh tokens MUST be **unguessable and secure from modification**.
  - Authorization Servers MUST implement the following mechanism to **detect replay attacks**:

    - **Sender-Constrained Tokens**: Crypto-graphically bind the Refresh Token to the Wallet Instance according to :rfc:`9449`. Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens MUST be bound to the same DPoP key. The DPoP Proof of the refresh token is required to refresh an Access Token. The same DPoP key MUST be used to generate Access Token DPoP Proofs in all the Credential Requests.

  - **Limiting the use of Refresh Token**: As specified in `OPENID4VC-HAIP`_: “Credential Issuers should be mindful of how long the usage of the refresh token is allowed to refresh a Credential, as opposed to starting the issuance flow from the beginning. For example, if the User is trying to refresh a Credential more than a year after its original issuance, the usage of the refresh tokens is NOT RECOMMENDED.” In this specification a new Digital Credential obtained performing the re-issuance flow SHOULD have the same expiration of the refreshed one. Thus, this specification does not allow for infinite refresh of Digital Credential with a Refresh Token. Once a Digital Credential expires, the User MUST complete the entire issuance process again, to obtain a new Digital Credential. This specification recommends to set a Refresh Token expiration duration, based on the sensitivity of the associated grant.

.. note::
	*Short-lived Wallet Attestations and DPoP*:  Following the specification draft *OAuth 2.0 Attestation Based Client Authentication* (`OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_), the Authorization Server MUST bind the Refresh Token to the Client Instance. To prove this binding the Client Instance MUST use the Client Attestation mechanism when refreshing the Access Token and the Client Instance MUST use the same key that was presented in the ``cnf.jwk`` claim of the Client Attestation that was used when the Refresh Token was issued. However this requires that all issued Client Attestations MUST be bound to the same key, thus opening to unlinkability issues. In this specification, both `OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_ and *OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP)* (:rfc:`9449`) MUST be used. Using DPoP guarantees the binding of the Refresh Token with the Client Instance as stated in section 5 of :rfc:`9449` *"the Refresh Token MUST be bound to the respective public key [...] a Client MUST present a DPoP proof for the same key that was used to obtain the Refresh Token each time that Refresh Token is used to obtain a new Access Token"*. DPoP ensures that the Refresh Token is bound to the Wallet Instance.


Re-Issuance Flow
----------------

Re-issuance involves replacing Digital Credentials already stored in a Wallet Instance with new ones of the same document type. The new Digital Credentials MUST be issued by the same Credential Issuers that originally provided the existing ones to the same Wallet Instance.

To facilitate this, particularly in scenarios where User authentication is not strictly required, a Refresh Token (RT) flow MAY be used (see Section :ref:`Refresh Token Flow <Refresh Token Flow>` for more details). An Access Token obtained as a result of a Refresh Token flow  MUST NOT be used to issue a Digital Credential that is not present in the Wallet Instance (first-time-issuance). The Refresh Token mechanism enables automated Credential replacement, streamlining the process for both the Credential Issuer and the User.

The re-issuance process outlined in this section is limited to the following scenarios:

  - Data model/format technical update;
  - User's attribute set update.

In the first case, the new Digital Credential's Users attribute set will match the original one. For example, a Credential Issuer may need to update the Digital Credential metadata or data format without changing the User's attribute set. In this case, the direct involvement of the User is not mandatory for the replacement and storage of a Digital Credential.

In the second case, Credential Issuers may also need to modify one or more User's attribute values during re-issuance. In this case, the Wallet Instance MUST inform the User that the attribute data set has been changed and MUST then request the User's authorization to store the new Digital Credential.

In both cases, the newly issued Digital Credential MUST have the same expiry date as the previous one.

Re-issuance after Digital Credential expiration MUST always require User authentication.

The following diagram describes the Digital Credential re-issuance flow.

    Re-Issuance Flow Diagram


1. The flow starts when the User opens the Wallet Instance: this step MAY be triggered either by a notification sent by the Credential Issuer (using e.g., one of the out-of-band communication contacts registered during the Issuance flow).
2. Regardless of the Digital Credental revocation mechanism supported, if the Wallet Instance

   - only supports Status List and does not have a valid Status Token for a stored Digital Credential, Wallet Instance MUST retrieve a fresh one following the flow described in Section :ref:`OAuth Status Lists <OAuth Status Lists>`. If any Digital Credential has status set to ``0x03`` - ``UPDATE`` or ``0x04`` - ``ATTRIBUTE_UPDATE``; or else
   - together with the Credential Issuer additionally support Status Assertion and the Wallet Instance does not have a valid Status Assertion for a stored Digital Credential, the Wallet Instance MAY retrieve a fresh one following the flow described in Section :ref:`OAuth Status Assertions <OAuth Status Assertions>`. If any Digital Credentials has the ``credential_status_type`` set to ``INVALID``, the Wallet Instance MUST verify the ``credential_status_detail.state`` claim. If this claim is set to ``UPDATE`` or ``ATTRIBUTE_UPDATE``, then

     the Wallet Instance MUST check if the related Access Tokens are still valid. If the Access Token is valid, then step 3 MAY be skipped.

3. If the Access Token is expired and the Wallet Instance still has a valid Refresh Token, the Wallet Instance MUST obtain a new Access Token starting a Refresh Token Flow, according to Section :ref:`Refresh Token Flow <Refresh Token Flow>`. The Refresh Token Flow enables the Wallet Instance to obtain a new Refresh Token and a new DPoP Access Token to refresh the Digital Credential. If the Refresh Token is expired, a new Issuance Flow authenticating the User is required.
4. The Wallet Instance MUST use a valid DPoP Access Token to retrieve the new Digital Credential requesting it to the Credential endpoint following the steps from 12 to 22 of Figure 9 in Section :ref:`Low-Level Issuance Flow <Low-Level Issuance Flow>`. When the new Digital Credential is successfully stored in the secure storage, the Wallet Instance MUST delete the previous one.

.. note::

  Regardless of the Digital Credental revocation mechanism supported, if either the Digital Credential status is set to ``ATTRIBUTE_UPDATE`` (using OAuth Status List revocation) or ``credential_status_detail.state`` is set to ``ATTRIBUTE_UPDATE`` (using OAuth Status List revocation) the User's attribute set, in the refreshed Digital Credential, doesn't match the one in the stored Digital Credential. In this case, the Wallet Instance MUST request the User's authorization to store the new refreshed Digital Credential.

  If instead, either the Digital Credential status is set to ``UPDATE``(using OAuth Status List revocation) or ``credential_status_detail.state`` set to ``UPDATE`` (using OAuth Status List revocation) the the ``credential_status_detail.state`` is set to ``UPDATE``, only the Credential metadata parameters have changed. In this case, the Wallet Instance SHOULD store the new Digital Credential without requiring explicit user authorization and consent.


Security Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To ensure the integrity and security of the re-issuance process, the following security considerations apply.

  - Access Token limitations: An Access Token obtained as a result of a Refresh Token flow MUST NOT be used for the first-time issuance of a Digital Credential. This ensures that only existing Credentials in the Wallet Instance are updated.
  - Credential expiry: The Credential Issuer MUST set the same expiry date for the re-issued Digital Credential as the previous one. This prevents indefinite Credential renewals without proper User authentication.
  - User consent: For re-issuance processes triggered by attribute changes, User consent MUST be obtained before storing the new Digital Credential. This ensures that the User is aware of and agrees to the updated information.
  - Sender-constrained Refresh Token: Refresh Tokens MUST be cryptographically bound to the Wallet Instance using DPoP protocol. This mitigates the risk of token misuse by ensuring that only the intended Wallet Instance (the same that originally has obtained the Digital Credential) can use that Refresh Token.


Credential Offer Endpoint
-------------------------------------
The Credential Offer endpoint of a Wallet is used by PID/(Q)EAA Issuer to interact with the User to initiate a Credential Issuance. The custom URL scheme ``openid-credential-offer://`` MUST be used.

Credential Offer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Credential Offer made by PID/(Q)EAA Issuer consists of a single URI query parameter ``credential_offer``. The Credential Offer URL MAY be included in a QR Code or in an html page with an href button and MUST contain the following mandatory parameters:

.. _table_credential_offer_claim:
.. list-table::
  :widths: 20 60 20
  :header-rows: 1

  * - **Claim**
    - **Description**
    - **Reference**
  * - **credential_issuer**
    - It MUST be set with an HTTPS URL that uniquely identifies the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer. The Wallet uses this parameter value to obtain the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer's metadata.
    - Section 4.1.1 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].
  * - **credential_configuration_ids**
    - Array of Strings, each of them specifying a unique identifier of the Credential being described in the ``credential_configurations_supported`` map in the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer Metadata.
    - Section 4.1.1 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].
  * - **grants**
    - It MUST contain ``authorization_code`` object with the following parameters:

        - **issuer_state**: REQUIRED. Opaque string created by the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer used to bind the subsequent Authorization Request with the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer. The Wallet MUST include it in the subsequent Authorization Request.
        - **authorization_server**: REQUIRED when the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer uses more than one authorization server in its Issuer Solution. String identifying the Authorization Server to use. The value MUST match with one of the values mapped in the ``authorization_servers`` array of the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer metadata. It MUST NOT be used if ``authorization_servers`` is absent or it has no multiple entries.
    - Section 4.1.1 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].


Credential Offer Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
No response is expected from the Wallet.


Pushed Authorization Request Endpoint
-------------------------------------

Pushed Authorization Request (PAR) Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The request to the PID/(Q)EAA authorization endpoint MUST use HTTP Headers parameters and HTTP POST parameters.

The HTTP POST method MUST use the parameters in the message body encoded in ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` format.

.. _table_http_request_claim:
.. list-table:: PAR http request parameters
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Claim**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **client_id**
      - MUST be set to the thumbprint of the ``jwk`` value in the ``cnf`` parameter inside the Wallet Attestation.
      - :rfc:`6749`
    * - **request**
      - It MUST be a signed JWT. The private key corresponding to the public one in the ``cnf`` parameter inside the Wallet Attestation MUST be used for signing the Request Object.
      - `OpenID Connect Core. Section 6 <https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests>`_

The Pushed Authorization Endpoint is protected with OAuth 2.0 Attestation-based Client Authentication [`OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_], therefore
the request to the PID/(Q)EAA authorization endpoint MUST use the following HTTP Headers parameters:


.. _table_http_request_headers_claim:
.. list-table:: http request header parameters
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **OAuth-Client-Attestation**
      - It MUST be set to a value containing the Wallet Attestation JWT.
      - `OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_.
    * - **OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP**
      - It MUST be set to a value containing the Wallet Attestation JWT Proof of Possession.
      - `OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_.


The JWT *Request Object* has the following JOSE header parameters:

.. _table_request_object_claim:
.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **JOSE header**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **alg**
      - A digital signature algorithm identifier such as per IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry. It MUST be one of the supported algorithms listed in the Section `Cryptographic Algorithms <algorithms.html>`_ and MUST NOT be set to ``none`` or any symmetric algorithm (MAC) identifier.
      - :rfc:`7516#section-4.1.1`.

      -  Unique identifier of the ``jwk`` inside the ``cnf`` claim of Wallet Attestation as base64url-encoded JWK Thumbprint value.
      - :rfc:`7638#section_3`.

.. note::
  The parameter **typ**, if omitted, assumes the implicit value **JWT**.


The ``request`` JWT payload contained in the HTTP POST message is given with the following parameters:

.. _table_jwt_request:
.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Claim**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **iss**
      - It MUST be set to the ``client_id``.
      - :rfc:`9126` and :rfc:`7519`.
    * - **aud**
      - It MUST be set to the identifier of the PID/(Q)EAA Provider.
      - :rfc:`9126` and :rfc:`7519`.
    * - **exp**
      - UNIX Timestamp with the expiry time of the JWT. The claim value MUST be not greater than 300 seconds from the issuance time.
      - :rfc:`9126` and :rfc:`7519`.
    * - **iat**
      - UNIX Timestamp with the time of JWT issuance.
      - :rfc:`9126` and :rfc:`7519`.
    * - **response_type**
      - MUST be set to ``code``.
      - :rfc:`6749`
    * - **response_mode**
      - It MUST be a string indicating the "*response_mode*", as specified in [`OAUTH-MULT-RESP-TYPE`_]. It MUST be one of the supported values (*response_modes_supported*) provided in the metadata of the PID/(Q)EAA Provider. It informs the PID/(Q)EAA Provider of the mechanism to be used for returning parameters from the Authorization Endpoint. In case of *HTTP 302 Redirect Response* the value MUST be *query*. In this mode, Authorization Response parameters are encoded in the query string added to the ``redirect_uri`` when redirecting back to the Wallet Instance. In case of *HTTP POST Response* the value MUST be *form_post.jwt* according to [`JARM`_]. In this mode, Authorization Response parameters are specified into a JWT encoded as HTML form value that is auto-submitted in the user-agent, and thus is transmitted via the HTTP POST method to the Wallet Instance, with the result parameters being encoded in the body using the *application/x-www-form-urlencoded* format. The action attribute of the form MUST be the Redirection URI of the Wallet Instance. The method of the form attribute MUST be POST.
      - See [`OAUTH-MULT-RESP-TYPE`_] and [`JARM`_].
    * - **client_id**
      - It MUST be set as in the :ref:`Table of the HTTP parameters <table_http_request_claim>`.
      - See :ref:`Table of the HTTP parameters <table_http_request_claim>`.
    * - **state**
      - Unique session identifier at the client side. This value will be returned to the client in the response, at the end of the authentication. It MUST be a random string composed by alphanumeric characters and with a minimum length of 32 digits. Special characters MUST be considered non-alphanumeric characters as defined in `[NIST] <https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/special_character>`__.
      - See [`OIDC`_] Section 3.1.2.1.
    * - **code_challenge**
      - A challenge derived from the **code verifier** that is sent in the authorization request.
      - :rfc:`7636#section-4.2`.
    * - **code_challenge_method**
      - A method that was used to derive **code challenge**. It MUST be set to ``S256``.
      - :rfc:`7636#section-4.3`.
    * - **scope**
      - JSON String. String specifying a unique identifier of the Credential regardless of its format. It MUST be mapped in the `credential_configurations_supported` metadata claim of the Credential Issuer. Unique identifier value MUST match the `credential_type` parameter of the Digital Credentials Catalogue. For example, in the case of the PID, it may be set to ``PersonIdentificationData`` while in case of mobile driving licence ``mDL``. Since it MAY be multivalued, when this occurs each value MUST be separated by a space.
      - :rfc:`6749`
    * - **authorization_details**
      - Array of JSON Objects. Each JSON Object MUST include the following claims:

            - **type**: it MUST be set to ``openid_credential``,
            - **credential_configuration_id**: JSON String. String specifying a unique identifier of the Credential in a specific format that MUST be mapped in the `credential_configurations_supported` metadata claim of the Credential Issuer. For instance,``dc_sd_jwt_PersonIdentificationData`` can be used for PID in SD-JWT VC format, ``dc_sd_jwt_mDL`` for mobile driving licence in SD-JWT VC format and ``mso_mdoc_mDL`` for mobile driving license in mdoc format.
      - See [RAR :rfc:`9396`] and [`OpenID4VCI`_].
    * - **redirect_uri**
      -  Redirection URI to which the response is intended to be sent. It MUST be an universal or app link registered with the local operating system, so this latter will provide the response to the Wallet Instance.
      - See [`OIDC`_] Section 3.1.2.1.
    * - **jti**
      - Unique identifier of the JWT that, together with the value contained in the ``iss`` claim,  prevents the reuse of the JWT (replay attack). Since the `jti` value alone is not collision resistant, it MUST be identified uniquely together with its issuer.
      - [:rfc:`7519`].
    * - **issuer_state**
      - It MUST be present only in case of issuer initiated flow. It MUST contain the same value contained in the Credential Offer.
      - [:rfc:`7519`].

.. note::

    If the request cointains scope value and the *authorization_details* parameter the Credential Issuer MUST interpret these individually. However, if both request the same Credential type, then the Credential Issuer MUST follow the request as given by the authorization details object.

The JOSE header of the Wallet Attestation proof of possession, contained in the HTTP Request headers, MUST contain:

.. _table_jwt_pop:

Authorization endpoint
----------------------

The authorization endpoint is used to interact with the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer and obtain an authorization grant.
The authorization server MUST first verify the identity of the User that own the credential.


Authorization Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Authorization request is issued by the Web Browser in use by the Wallet Instance, the HTTP methods **POST** or **GET** are used. When the method **POST** is used, the parameters MUST be sent using the *Form Serialization*. When the method **GET** is used, the parameters MUST be sent using the *Query String Serialization*. For more details see Section 13 of [`OIDC`_].

The mandatory parameters in the HTTP authentication request are specified in the following table.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Claim**
      - **Description**

      - It MUST be set to the same value as obtained by PAR Response. See :ref:`Table of the HTTP PAR Response parameters <table_http_response_claim>`.
      - [:rfc:`9126`].


Authorization Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The authentication response is returned by the PID/(Q)EAA authorization endpoint at the end of the authentication flow.

If the authentication is successful the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer redirects the User by adding the following query parameters as required to the *redirect_uri*. The redirect URI MUST be an universal or app link registered with the local operating system, so this latter is able to provide the response to the Wallet Instance.

.. list-table::

      - [:rfc:`9207`], [:rfc:`7519`, Section 4.1.1.].

If any errors occur during the Authorization Request, the Authorization Server MUST return an error response as defined in :rfc:`6749#section-4.1.2.1`.
In case of invalid/missing ``redirect_uri`` or ``client_id`` Authorization Server MUST inform the User with the error and MUST NOT redirect the User to the redirection URI.
If any other error occurs the Authorization Server MUST redirect the User by adding the following query parameters as required to the *redirect_uri* using the *application/x-www-form-urlencoded* format:

  - *error*. The error code.
  - *error_description*. Text in human-readable form providing further details to clarify the nature of the error encountered.
  - *state*. The exact value of ``state`` parameter contained in the Request Object.

Below is a non-normative example of an error response.

Token endpoint
--------------

The token endpoint is used by the Wallet Instance to obtain an Access Token by presenting an authorization grant, as
defined in :rfc:`6749`. The Token Endpoint is a protected endpoint with a client authentication based on the model defined in OAuth 2.0 Attestation-based Client Authentication [`OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_ ].

.. _sec_token_request:

Token Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The request to the PID/(Q)EAA Token endpoint MUST be an HTTP request with method POST, with the body message encoded in ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` format. The Wallet Instance sends the Token endpoint request with ``OAuth-Client-Attestation`` and ``OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP`` as header parameters according to `OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_.

The Token endpoint is protected with *OAuth 2.0 Attestation-based Client Authentication* [`OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_], therefore
the request to the PID/(Q)EAA authorization endpoint MUST use the following HTTP Headers parameters **OAuth-Client-Attestation** as **OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP**
as defined in the "Pushed Authorization Request (PAR) Endpoint".

The Token endpoint issues DPoP tokens, therefore it is REQUIRED that the request includes in its HTTP header the DPoP proof parameter.
The Authorization Server MUST validate the DPoP proof received at the Token endpoint, according to :rfc:`9449` Section 4.3. This mitigates the misuse of leaked or stolen Access Tokens/Refresh Tokens at the Credential/Token endpoint. If the DPoP proof is invalid, the Token endpoint returns an error response, according to Section 5.2 of [:rfc:`6749`] with ``invalid_dpop_proof`` as the value of the error parameter.

The token request contains the following claims:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 60 20

      - REQUIRED only if the grant type is ``refresh_token``. The Refresh Token previously issued to the Wallet Instance. It MUST NOT be present if grant type is ``authorization_code``.
      - [:rfc:`6749`].
    * - **scope**
      - OPTIONAL only if the grant type is ``refresh_token``. The requested scope MUST NOT include any scope not originally granted by the User, and if omitted is treated as equal to the scope originally granted by the User. It MUST NOT be present if grant type is ``authorization_code``.
      - [:rfc:`6749`].


A **DPoP Proof JWT** is included in the HTTP request using the ``DPoP`` header parameter containing a DPoP JWT.

The JOSE header of a **DPoP JWT** MUST contain at least the following parameters:

Nonce endpoint
--------------

The Nonce Endpoint provides a ``c_nonce`` value useful to create a proof of possession of key material for the request to the Credential Endpoint, as defined in Section 7 of `OpenID4VCI`_.

Nonce Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The request for a nonce MUST be an HTTP POST without a body addressed to the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer Nonce Endpoint mapped in the Credential Issuer Metadata.


Nonce Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nonce Response to the Wallet Instance MUST be sent using `application/json` media type. In case of Nonce Request successful, the PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST return HTTP response with a *200 (OK)* status code.

As defined in Section 7.2 of `OpenID4VCI`_, the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer MUST make the response uncacheable by adding a ``Cache-Control`` header field valued with *no-store*.

The Nonce Response contains the following parameter:

Deferred Endpoint
-----------------

PID/(Q)EAA Providers MAY support the *Deferred Endpoint* aiming to satify the cases where an immediate issuance might be not possible, due to errors during the communication between the PID/(Q)EAA Provider and the Authentic Source (for example the Authentic Source is temporarily unavailable, etc.) or due to administrative or technical processes.

In the case where the Authentic Source and the PID/(Q)EAA Provider are both enabled to use *PDND*, what is described in Section :ref:`Authentic Sources` MUST apply.


The following requirements apply:

 1. The Deferred Credential request MAY also happen several days after the initial Credential request.
 2. The User MUST be informed that the Credential is available and ready to be issued.
 3. The Wallet Provider MUST NOT be informed about which Credential is available to be issued or which Credential Issuer the User needs to contact.
 4. The Wallet Instance MUST be informed about the amount of time to wait before making a new Credential request.
 5. As, in general, an unavailability may be an unexpected event, the PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST be able to switch on the fly between a *immediate* and an *deferred* flow. This decision MUST be taken after the authorization step.


If PID/(Q)EAA Providers, supporting this flow, are not able to immediately issue a requested Credential, they MUST provide the Wallet Instance with an HTTP Credential Response cointaining the amount of time to wait before making a new Credential request and an identifier of the deferred issuance transaction (*transaction_id*). The HTTP status code MUST be *202* (see Section 15.3.3 of [:rfc:`9110`]). Below a non-normative example is given.

.. code-block:: http

  HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
  Content-Type: application/json
  Cache-Control: no-store

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/credential-response-deferred.json
  :language: JSON

The Wallet Instance MUST use the value given in the *lead_time* parameter to inform the User when the Credential becomes available (e.g. using a local notification triggered by the *lead_time* time value). PID/(Q)EAA Providers MAY send a notification to the User through a communication channel (e.g. email address), if previously provided by the User to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider.

Deferred Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon receipt of the notification (by the Wallet Instance and/or by the PID/(Q)EAA Provider), the User accesses the Wallet Instance.

The Wallet Instance MUST present to the Deferred Endpoint an Access Token that is valid for the issuance of the Digital Credential previously requested at the Credential Endpoint.

If the ``lead_time`` parameter value results as less than the expiration time set for the Access Token, the Wallet Instance SHOULD use the Access Token. Otherwise,  the Wallet Instance MAY obtain a new Access Token following the Refresh Token flow (see Section :ref:`Refresh Token Flow <Refresh Token Flow>` for more details). If the Refresh Token flow fails, the Wallet Instance needs to submit a new authentication request.

The Deferred Credential Request MUST be an HTTP POST request. It MUST be sent using the ``application/json`` media type.
The following parameter is used in the Deferred Credential Request:

  - ``transaction_id``: REQUIRED. String identifying a Deferred Issuance transaction.

The Credential Issuer MUST invalidate the ``transaction_id`` after the Credential for which it was meant has been obtained by the Wallet Instance.
The following is a non-normative example of a Deferred Credential Request:

.. code::

  POST /credential HTTP/1.1

  {
    "transaction_id": "8xLOxBtZp8"
  }

Deferred Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Deferred Credential Response MUST be sent using the `application/json`` media type. If the Digital Credential is available, the Deferred Credential Response MUST use the ``credentials`` and ``notification_id`` parameters as defined in Section :ref:`Credential Response <Credential Response>`. If the Deferred Credential Request is invalid or the Digital Credential is not available, the Deferred Credential Error Response MUST be sent to the Wallet Instance according to Section 9.3 of `OpenID4VCI`_.

Notification endpoint
---------------------

The Notification Endpoint is used by the Wallet to notify the PID/(Q)EAA Provider of certain events for issued Credentials, such as if the Credential was successfully stored in the Wallet Instance.

To uphold privacy, the ``event_description`` in the notification SHOULD NOT contain any information that could disclose User behavior or reveal the status of the personal device (e.g., storage space full).

This endpoint MUST be protected using a DPoP Access Token. TLS for the confidentiality of the HTTP transport is REQUIRED according to Section 10 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].


Notification Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Notification Request MUST be an HTTP POST using the *application/json* media type with the following parameters.

    - Section 10.1 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].



Notification Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Notification Response MUST be use an HTTP status code *204 (No Content)*, as recommended in Section 10.2 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].

In case of errors, what is described in Section 10.3 of [`OpenID4VCI`_] MUST apply.

In case of the Notification Request does not contain a valid Access Token, the Notification Endpoint returns an error response such as defined in Section 3 of [:rfc:`6750`].
If any other error occurs, the PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST return an error response as defined in Section 10.3 of [`OpenID4VCI`_]. The response MUST use the content type *application/json* and MUST include the following parameters:

  - *error*. The error code.
  - *error_description*. Text in human-readable form providing further details to clarify the nature of the error encountered.
