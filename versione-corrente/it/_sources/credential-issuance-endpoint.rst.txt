Credential Issuance Endpoints
==============================

Credential Offer Endpoint
-------------------------
The Credential Offer endpoint of a Wallet is used by Credential Issuer to interact with the User to initiate a Credential Issuance. The custom URL scheme ``openid-credential-offer://`` MUST be used.

Credential Offer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Credential Offer made by Credential Issuer consists of a single URI query parameter ``credential_offer``. The Credential Offer URL MAY be included in a QR Code or in an html page with an href button and MUST contain the following mandatory parameters:

.. _table_credential_offer_claim:
.. list-table::
  :class: longtable
  :widths: 20 60 20
  :header-rows: 1

  * - **Claim**
    - **Description**
    - **Reference**
  * - **credential_issuer**
    - It MUST be set with an HTTPS URL that uniquely identifies the Credential Issuer. The Wallet uses this parameter value to obtain the Credential Issuer's metadata.
    - Section 4.1.1 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].
  * - **credential_configuration_ids**
    - Array of Strings, each of them specifying a unique identifier of the Credential being described in the ``credential_configurations_supported`` map in the Credential Issuer Metadata.
    - Section 4.1.1 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].
  * - **grants**
    - It MUST contain ``authorization_code`` object with the following parameters:

        - **issuer_state**: REQUIRED. Opaque string created by the Credential Issuer used to bind the subsequent Authorization Request with the Credential Issuer. The Wallet MUST include it in the subsequent Authorization Request.
        - **authorization_server**: REQUIRED when the Credential Issuer uses more than one authorization server in its Issuer Solution. String identifying the Authorization Server to use. The value MUST match with one of the values mapped in the ``authorization_servers`` array of the Credential Issuer metadata. It MUST NOT be used if ``authorization_servers`` is absent or it has no multiple entries.
    - Section 4.1.1 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].


Credential Offer Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
No response is expected from the Wallet.


Pushed Authorization Request Endpoint
-------------------------------------

Pushed Authorization Request (PAR) Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The request to the Credential Issuer authorization endpoint MUST use HTTP Headers parameters and HTTP POST parameters.

The HTTP POST method MUST use the parameters in the message body encoded in ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` format.

.. _table_http_request_claim:
.. list-table:: PAR http request parameters
    :class: longtable
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **client_id**
      - MUST be set to the thumbprint of the ``jwk`` value in the ``cnf`` parameter inside the Wallet Attestation.
      - :rfc:`6749`
    * - **request**
      - It MUST be a signed JWT. The private key corresponding to the public one in the ``cnf`` parameter inside the Wallet Attestation MUST be used for signing the Request Object.
      - `OpenID Connect Core. Section 6 <https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests>`_

The Pushed Authorization Endpoint is protected with OAuth 2.0 Attestation-based Client Authentication [`OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_], therefore
the request to the Credential Issuer authorization endpoint MUST use the following HTTP Headers parameters:

.. _table_http_request_headers_claim:
.. list-table:: http request header parameters
    :class: longtable
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

      - It MUST be set to a value containing the Wallet Attestation JWT.
      - `OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_.
    * - **OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP**
      - It MUST be set to a value containing the Wallet Attestation JWT Proof of Possession.
      - `OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_.


The JWT *Request Object* has the following JOSE header parameters:

.. _table_request_object_claim:
.. list-table::

    * - **response_mode**
      - It MUST be a string indicating the "*response_mode*", as specified in [`OAUTH-MULT-RESP-TYPE`_]. It MUST be one of the supported values (*response_modes_supported*) provided in the metadata of the Credential Issuer. It informs the Credential Issuer of the mechanism to be used for returning parameters from the Authorization Endpoint. In case of *HTTP 302 Redirect Response* the value MUST be *query*. In this mode, Authorization Response parameters are encoded in the query string added to the ``redirect_uri`` when redirecting back to the Wallet Instance. In case of *HTTP POST Response* the value MUST be *form_post.jwt* according to [`JARM`_]. In this mode, Authorization Response parameters are specified into a JWT encoded as HTML form value that is auto-submitted in the user-agent, and thus is transmitted via the HTTP POST method to the Wallet Instance, with the result parameters being encoded in the body using the *application/x-www-form-urlencoded* format. The action attribute of the form MUST be the Redirection URI of the Wallet Instance. The method of the form attribute MUST be POST.

    * - **client_id**
      - It MUST be set as in the :ref:`Table of the HTTP parameters <table_http_request_claim>`.
      - See :ref:`Table of the HTTP parameters <table_http_request_claim>`.

      - Unique session identifier at the client side. This value will be returned to the client in the response, at the end of the authentication. It MUST be a random string composed by alphanumeric characters and with a minimum length of 32 digits. Special characters MUST be considered non-alphanumeric characters as defined in `[NIST] <https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/special_character>`__.
      - See [`OIDC`_] Section 3.1.2.1.
    * - **code_challenge**
      - A challenge derived from the **code verifier** that is sent in the authorization request.
      - :rfc:`7636#section-4.2`.
    * - **code_challenge_method**
      - A method that was used to derive **code challenge**. It MUST be set to ``S256``.
      - :rfc:`7636#section-4.3`.
    * - **scope**
      - JSON String. String specifying a unique identifier of the Credential regardless of its format. It MUST be mapped in the `credential_configurations_supported` metadata claim of the Credential Issuer. Unique identifier value MUST match the `credential_type` parameter of the Digital Credentials Catalogue. For example, in the case of the PID, it may be set to ``PersonIdentificationData`` while in case of mobile driving licence ``mDL``. Since it MAY be multivalued, when this occurs each value MUST be separated by a space.
      - :rfc:`6749`
    * - **authorization_details**
      - Array of JSON Objects. Each JSON Object MUST include the following claims:

            - **type**: it MUST be set to ``openid_credential``,
            - **credential_configuration_id**: JSON String. String specifying a unique identifier of the Credential in a specific format that MUST be mapped in the `credential_configurations_supported` metadata claim of the Credential Issuer. For instance,``dc_sd_jwt_PersonIdentificationData`` can be used for PID in SD-JWT VC format, ``dc_sd_jwt_mDL`` for mobile driving licence in SD-JWT VC format and ``mso_mdoc_mDL`` for mobile driving license in mdoc format.
      - See [RAR :rfc:`9396`] and [`OpenID4VCI`_].
    * - **redirect_uri**
      - Redirection URI to which the response is intended to be sent. It MUST be an universal or app link registered with the local operating system, so this latter will provide the response to the Wallet Instance.
      - See [`OIDC`_] Section 3.1.2.1.
    * - **jti**
      - Unique identifier of the JWT that, together with the value contained in the ``iss`` claim, prevents the reuse of the JWT (replay attack). Since the `jti` value alone is not collision resistant, it MUST be identified uniquely together with its issuer.
      - [:rfc:`7519`].
    * - **issuer_state**
      - It MUST be present only in case of issuer initiated flow. It MUST contain the same value contained in the Credential Offer.
      - [:rfc:`7519`].

.. note::
  If the request cointains scope value and the *authorization_details* parameter the Credential Issuer MUST interpret these individually. However, if both request the same Credential type, then the Credential Issuer MUST follow the request as given by the authorization details object.

The JOSE header of the Wallet Attestation proof of possession, contained in the HTTP Request headers, MUST contain:

.. _table_jwt_pop:
.. list-table::

Authorization endpoint
----------------------

The authorization endpoint is used to interact with the Credential Issuer and obtain an authorization grant.
The authorization server MUST first verify the identity of the User that own the credential.


Authorization Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Authorization request is issued by the Web Browser in use by the Wallet Instance, the HTTP methods **POST** or **GET** are used. When the method **POST** is used, the parameters MUST be sent using the *Form Serialization*. When the method **GET** is used, the parameters MUST be sent using the *Query String Serialization*. For more details see Section 13 of [`OIDC`_].

The mandatory parameters in the HTTP authentication request are specified in the following table.

.. list-table::
    :class: longtable
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Claim**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **client_id**
      - It MUST be set as in the :ref:`Table of the HTTP parameters <table_http_request_claim>`.
      - See :ref:`Table of the HTTP parameters <table_http_request_claim>`.
    * - **request_uri**
      - It MUST be set to the same value as obtained by PAR Response. See :ref:`Table of the HTTP PAR Response parameters <table_http_response_claim>`.
      - [:rfc:`9126`].

Authorization Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The authentication response is returned by the Credential issuer authorization endpoint at the end of the authentication flow.

If the authentication is successful the Credential Issuer redirects the User by adding the following query parameters as required to the *redirect_uri*. The redirect URI MUST be an universal or app link registered with the local operating system, so this latter is able to provide the response to the Wallet Instance.

.. list-table::
    :class: longtable
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Claim**
      - **Description**

    * - **code**
      - Unique *Authorization Code* that the Wallet Instance submits to the Token Endpoint.
      - [:rfc:`6749#section-4.1.2`], [:rfc:`7521`].
    * - **state**
      - The Wallet Instance MUST check the correspondence with the ``state`` parameter value in the Request Object. It is defined as in the :ref:`Table of the JWT Request parameters <table_jwt_request>`.
      - [:rfc:`6749#section-4.1.2`].
    * - **iss**
      - Unique identifier of the Credential Issuer who created the Authentication Response. The Wallet Instance MUST validate this parameter.
      - [:rfc:`9207`], [:rfc:`7519`, Section 4.1.1.].

If any errors occur during the Authorization Request, the Authorization Server MUST return an error response as defined in :rfc:`6749#section-4.1.2.1`.
In case of invalid/missing ``redirect_uri`` or ``client_id`` Authorization Server MUST inform the User with the error and MUST NOT redirect the User to the redirection URI.
If any other error occurs the Authorization Server MUST redirect the User by adding the following query parameters as required to the *redirect_uri* using the *application/x-www-form-urlencoded* format:

  - *error*. The error code.
  - *error_description*. Text in human-readable form providing further details to clarify the nature of the error encountered.
  - *state*. The exact value of ``state`` parameter contained in the Request Object.

Below is a non-normative example of an error response.

.. code:: http

  HTTP/1.1 302 Found
  Location: https://client.example.com/cb?
   error=invalid_request
   &error_description=Unsupported%20response_type%20value
   &state=fyZiOL9Lf2CeKuNT2JzxiLRDink0uPcd

In case of Authorization Server redirects the User to the *redirect_uri* HTTP status code *302 (Found)* MUST be used. The following error codes are supported for the error response:

      - ``unauthorized_client``
      - The Credential Issuer cannot fulfill the request because the client is not authorized to request an authorization code. (:rfc:`6749#section-4.1.2.1`).
    * - *302 Found* [REQUIRED]
      - ``server_error``
      - The Credential Issuer encountered an internal problem. (:rfc:`6749#section-4.1.2.1`).

Token endpoint
--------------

The token endpoint is used by the Wallet Instance to obtain an Access Token by presenting an authorization grant, as
defined in :rfc:`6749`. The Token Endpoint is a protected endpoint with a client authentication based on the model defined in OAuth 2.0 Attestation-based Client Authentication [`OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_ ].


Token Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The request to the Credential Issuer Token endpoint MUST be an HTTP request with method POST, with the body message encoded in ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` format. The Wallet Instance sends the Token endpoint request with ``OAuth-Client-Attestation`` and ``OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP`` as header parameters according to `OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_.

The Token endpoint is protected with *OAuth 2.0 Attestation-based Client Authentication* [`OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_], therefore
the request to the Credential Issuer authorization endpoint MUST use the following HTTP Headers parameters **OAuth-Client-Attestation** as **OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP**
as defined in the "Pushed Authorization Request (PAR) Endpoint".

The Token endpoint issues DPoP tokens, therefore it is REQUIRED that the request includes in its HTTP header the DPoP proof parameter.
The Authorization Server MUST validate the DPoP proof received at the Token endpoint, according to :rfc:`9449` Section 4.3. This mitigates the misuse of leaked or stolen Access Tokens/Refresh Tokens at the Credential/Token endpoint. If the DPoP proof is invalid, the Token endpoint returns an error response, according to Section 5.2 of [:rfc:`6749`] with ``invalid_dpop_proof`` as the value of the error parameter.

The token request contains the following claims:

.. list-table::
    :class: longtable
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Claim**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**

      - REQUIRED. It MUST be set to ``authorization_code`` or ``refresh_token``.
      - [:rfc:`6749`].
    * - **code**
      - REQUIRED only if the grant type is ``authorization_code``. Authorization code returned in the Authentication Response. It MUST NOT be present if grant type is ``refresh_token``.
      - [:rfc:`6749`].
    * - **redirect_uri**
      - REQUIRED only if the grant type is ``authorization_code``. It MUST be set as in the Request Object :ref:`Table of the JWT Request parameters <table_jwt_request>`. It MUST NOT be present if grant type is ``refresh_token``.
      - [:rfc:`67491`].
    * - **code_verifier**
      - REQUIRED only if the grant type is ``authorization_code``. Verification code of the **code_challenge**.
      - `Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636>`_. It MUST NOT be present if grant type is ``refresh_token``.
    * - **refresh_token**
      - REQUIRED only if the grant type is ``refresh_token``. The Refresh Token previously issued to the Wallet Instance. It MUST NOT be present if grant type is ``authorization_code``.
      - [:rfc:`6749`].
    * - **scope**
      - OPTIONAL only if the grant type is ``refresh_token``. The requested scope MUST NOT include any scope not originally granted by the User, and if omitted is treated as equal to the scope originally granted by the User. It MUST NOT be present if grant type is ``authorization_code``.
      - [:rfc:`6749`].


A **DPoP Proof JWT** is included in the HTTP request using the ``DPoP`` header parameter containing a DPoP JWT.

The JOSE header of a **DPoP JWT** MUST contain at least the following parameters:

Deferred Endpoint
-----------------

Credential Issuers MAY support the *Deferred Endpoint* aiming to satify the cases where an immediate issuance might be not possible, due to errors during the communication between the Credential Issuer and the Authentic Source (for example the Authentic Source is temporarily unavailable, etc.) or due to administrative or technical processes.

In the case where the Authentic Source and the Credential Issuer are both enabled to use *PDND*, what is described in Section :ref:`authentic-sources:Authentic Sources` MUST apply.


The following requirements apply:

 1. The Deferred Credential request MAY also happen several days after the initial Credential request.
 2. The User MUST be informed that the Credential is available and ready to be issued.
 3. The Wallet Provider MUST NOT be informed about which Credential is available to be issued or which Credential Issuer the User needs to contact.
 4. The Wallet Instance MUST be informed about the amount of time to wait before making a new Credential request.
 5. As, in general, an unavailability may be an unexpected event, the Credential Issuer MUST be able to switch on the fly between a *immediate* and an *deferred* flow. This decision MUST be taken after the authorization step.


If Credential Issuers, supporting this flow, are not able to immediately issue a requested Credential, they MUST provide the Wallet Instance with an HTTP Credential Response cointaining the amount of time to wait before making a new Credential request and an identifier of the deferred issuance transaction (*transaction_id*). The HTTP status code MUST be *202* (see Section 15.3.3 of [:rfc:`9110`]). Below a non-normative example is given.

.. code-block:: http

  HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
  Content-Type: application/json
  Cache-Control: no-store

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/credential-response-deferred.json
  :language: JSON

The Wallet Instance MUST use the value given in the *lead_time* parameter to inform the User when the Credential becomes available (e.g. using a local notification triggered by the *lead_time* time value). Credential Issuers MAY send a notification to the User through a communication channel (e.g. email address), if previously provided by the User to the Credential Issuer.

Deferred Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon receipt of the notification (by the Wallet Instance and/or by the Credential Issuer), the User accesses the Wallet Instance.

The Wallet Instance MUST present to the Deferred Endpoint an Access Token that is valid for the issuance of the Digital Credential previously requested at the Credential Endpoint.

If the ``lead_time`` parameter value results as less than the expiration time set for the Access Token, the Wallet Instance SHOULD use the Access Token. Otherwise, the Wallet Instance MAY obtain a new Access Token following the Refresh Token flow (see Section :ref:`credential-issuance-low-level:Refresh Token Flow` for more details). If the Refresh Token flow fails, the Wallet Instance needs to submit a new authentication request.

The Deferred Credential Request MUST be an HTTP POST request. It MUST be sent using the ``application/json`` media type.
The following parameter is used in the Deferred Credential Request:

  - ``transaction_id``: REQUIRED. String identifying a Deferred Issuance transaction.

The Credential Issuer MUST invalidate the ``transaction_id`` after the Credential for which it was meant has been obtained by the Wallet Instance.
The following is a non-normative example of a Deferred Credential Request:

.. code::

  POST /credential HTTP/1.1
  Host: eaa-provider.example.org
  Content-Type: application/json
  Authorization: DPoP Kz~8mXK1EalYznwH-LC-1fBAo.4Ljp~zsPE_NeO.gxU

  }

Deferred Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Deferred Credential Response MUST be sent using the `application/json`` media type. If the Digital Credential is available, the Deferred Credential Response MUST use the ``credentials`` and ``notification_id`` parameters as defined in Section :ref:`credential-issuance-endpoint:Credential Response`. If the Deferred Credential Request is invalid or the Digital Credential is not available, the Deferred Credential Error Response MUST be sent to the Wallet Instance according to Section 9.3 of `OpenID4VCI`_.

Notification endpoint
---------------------

The Notification Endpoint is used by the Wallet to notify the Credential Issuer of certain events for issued Credentials, such as if the Credential was successfully stored in the Wallet Instance.

To uphold privacy, the ``event_description`` in the notification SHOULD NOT contain any information that could disclose User behavior or reveal the status of the personal device (e.g., storage space full).

This endpoint MUST be protected using a DPoP Access Token. TLS for the confidentiality of the HTTP transport is REQUIRED according to Section 10 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].


Notification Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Notification Request MUST be an HTTP POST using the *application/json* media type with the following parameters.

.. list-table::
  :class: longtable
  :widths: 20 60 25
  :header-rows: 1

  * - **Claim**
    - **Description**
    - **Reference**
  * - **notification_id**
    - REQUIRED. It MUST be equal to the ``notification_id`` value returned in the Credential Response by the Credential Issuer.
    - Section 10.1 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].
  * - **event**
    - REQUIRED. Type of the notification event. It MUST be a case sensitive string and it MUST support the following values:

      - *credential_accepted*: when the Credential was successfully stored in the Wallet Instance.
      - *credential_deleted*: when the unsuccessful Credential issuance was caused by a user action.
      - *credential_failure*: in all other unsuccessful cases.

    - Section 10.1 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].
  * - **event_description**
    - OPTIONAL. Human-readable ASCII [USASCII] text providing additional information, used to inform about the event that occurred. Values for the event_description parameter MUST NOT include characters outside the set *%x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E*.
    - Section 10.1 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].

Notification Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Notification Response MUST be use an HTTP status code *204 (No Content)*, as recommended in Section 10.2 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].

In case of errors, what is described in Section 10.3 of [`OpenID4VCI`_] MUST apply.

In case of the Notification Request does not contain a valid Access Token, the Notification Endpoint returns an error response such as defined in Section 3 of [:rfc:`6750`].
If any other error occurs, the Credential Issuer MUST return an error response as defined in Section 10.3 of [`OpenID4VCI`_]. The response MUST use the content type *application/json* and MUST include the following parameters:

  - *error*. The error code.
  - *error_description*. Text in human-readable form providing further details to clarify the nature of the error encountered.

Below is a non-normative example of an error response.

.. code:: http

  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  Content-Type: application/json
  Cache-Control: no-store

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/notification-error.json
  :language: JSON

In the following table are listed HTTP Status Codes and related error codes that are supported for the error response:

.. list-table::
    :class: longtable
    :widths: 20 20 60
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Status Code**
      - **error code**
      - **Description**
    * - *400 Bad Request* [REQUIRED]
      - ``invalid_notification_id``
      - The Credential Issuer cannot fulfill the request because of invalid ``notification_id`` parameter. Section 10.3 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].
    * - *400 Bad Request* [REQUIRED]
      - ``invalid_notification_request``
      - The Credential Issuer cannot fulfill the request because of missing parameters, invalid parameter or request malformed. Section 10.3 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].
    * - *500 Internal Server Error* [REQUIRED]
      - ``server_error``
      - The Credential Issuer encountered an internal problem.
