Test Plans
==========

The purpose of the test plans is to support implementers, auditors, and conformance test environments in validating the behavior of the Wallet Solutions, Relying Parties and Credential Issuers under various operational and security scenarios.

All test cases are derived from normative rules defined in the above specifications, with no assumptions or extensions.

.. note::
  Please note that the test plans matrix may be subject to future changes.

Structure of the Test Matrix
-----------------------------

Each test case is identified by a unique test ID (e.g., WS-001) and categorized using the functional domains defined below. Other category identifiers can be used as well.

- **Discovery**
- **Security**
- **Authorization**
- **Authentication**
- **User Interaction**
- **User Notification**
- **Credential Issuance**
- **Proof of Possession**
- **Attestation Evaluation**
- **Credential Presentation**
