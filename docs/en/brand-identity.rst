IT-Wallet System Brand Identity
===============================


The IT-Wallet Brand Identity defines the system's personality and it's expressed through a set of standardized elements, including its naming and Visual Identity. It strengthens and promotes the Trust Model at the basis of the entire ecosystem, that is to say the framework that legitimizes the Actors' participation in the IT-Wallet System and ensures the security and integrity of its processes.

It is important to strengthen the User awareness and trust in the ecosystem by integrating coherent graphical elements into the Technical Solutions and across the various Touchpoints.

This section outlines the minimum requirements that Primary Actors must meet to ensure a proper application of the IT-Wallet System Brand Identity, to achieve a uniform, consistent, and recognizable visual presence, and deliver a high-quality User Experience.

For further details, please refer to the Official Resources.

Naming
------

"IT-Wallet System" is the official name that MUST be used in all written and verbal contexts, both physical and digital. Below are the requirements for the correct spelling and pronunciation:

- The use of uppercase letters for "IT" and the initials of "Wallet" and "System" MUST be followed;

- The hyphen (“-”) between "IT" and "Wallet" MUST be used without any spacing;

- The correct pronunciation of "IT" MUST be followed, with the two letters "I" and "T" pronounced separately. In Italian, the correct pronunciation is /i ti/, not /it/, while in English, it is /ai ti/, not /it/, /ait/, or /iti/.


Visual Identity
---------------

The IT-Wallet System has its own Visual Identity. All actors within the ecosystem MUST ensure that their Visual Identity and that of their Technical Solutions are distinct yet compatible and cohesive with the Visual Identity of IT-Wallet System. Specifically, all Primary Actors MAY use the Official Resources related to the Visual Identity of the IT-Wallet System. Their use MUST be exclusively aimed at representing the participation in the IT-Wallet System and not at replacing the Visual Identity of their own Technical Solutions.

Logo
^^^^

The Logo is the official graphic element that ensures immediate recognition of the IT-Wallet System and promotes its reliability.

The following requirements apply to its use in both physical and digital contexts (e.g., websites, apps, documents, printed materials, videos, etc.):

- The Logo MAY be used by anyone referring to the IT-Wallet System;

- The Logo MUST be used to represent the IT-Wallet System or the participation to the IT-Wallet System and MUST NOT be used to identify a specific Technical Solution;

- The Logo MAY be displayed alongside other actors' logos, trademarks, or symbols, in accordance with the coexistence specifications regarding proportions and visibility, as defined in the Official Resources.

Trust Mark
^^^^^^^^^^

The Trust Mark is the official graphic element that guarantees the belonging of Primary Actors and their respective Technical Solutions to the IT-Wallet System.

The following requirements apply to its use in both physical and digital contexts (e.g., websites, apps, documents, printed materials, videos, etc.):

- The Trust Mark MUST be used exclusively to certify the participation in the IT-Wallet System and MUST NOT be used for any other purpose;

- The Trust Mark MAY be displayed alongside other actors' logos, trademarks, or symbols, in accordance with the coexistence specifications regarding proportions and visibility, as defined in the Official Resources.

Components
^^^^^^^^^^

Components are the elements of the IT-Wallet System that enable the User to interact with several Technical Solutions via their Wallet Instance.

The Official Resources provide both complex components, such as templates to support entire workflows, and atomic components, like individual elements (e.g. Engagement Buttons) to be integrated into existing interfaces. 

The key requirements are as follows:

- Primary Actors MUST use Official Resources and MUST comply with the usage specifications outlined in the Official Resources;

- Primary Actors MAY choose from the available configurations, but MUST ensure the correct use of atomic components, such as the Engagement Buttons;

- Primary Actors MUST keep components up to date, in line with the latest available version.

Authentication Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Authentication Button is a type of Engagement Button.
Verifiers MUST make the Authentication Button available within the Discovery Page of their Technical Solutions to allow the User to get authenticated into their services through the Wallet Instance.

The integration of the Authentication Button within the Discovery Page may vary depending on the page layout. Below are illustrative, non-exhaustive examples of Discovery Pages using grid, tab, and list layouts, respectively.
