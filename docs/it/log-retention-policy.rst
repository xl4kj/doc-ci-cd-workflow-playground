General Log Retention Policies
=======================================

The retention of logs is a key element for ensuring security, including fraud prevention, incident detection, system integrity, and compliance with applicable legal obligations. It MUST also be align with the requirements defined in ISO/IEC 27001, in particular with regard auditability, access control, and secure storage. As long log management may involve the processing of personal data, it also constitutes a measure of accountability under the GDPR, with implications for data minimization, storage limitation, and purpose limitation; for these aspects, reference is made to the relevant provisions of the GDPR and sector-specific regulations.

For all about log handling, Wallet Providers, Credential Issuers, and Relying Parties are considered Organizational Entities.

Logs related to Wallet data exchange activities (accesses, transactions, Credential issuance/revocation) concerning the User, as the data subject, MUST be retained for a limited period for security, fraud prevention, dispute resolution, and legal obligations.

Organizational Entities are responsible for log retention according to their respective roles. Solutions related to Wallet Providers, Credential Issuers, and Relying Parties MUST implement audit logging for the activities of administrators and service operators with access to data exchange processes and logs.

Unless specific legal obligations dictate otherwise, and with the definition of sector-specific regulation defining appropriate motivations, **the maximum retention period for data logs is 12 months**. Logs MUST be securely stored to ensure integrity and immutability.

ISO/IEC 27001 Logging General Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Organizational Entities MUST implement appropriate technical and organization measured in compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 for maintaining an information security management system for monitoring, auditing, and incident response. Key aspects of log handling under ISO/IEC 27001 include the following requirements:

- **A.12.4 Logging and Monitoring**: Organizational Entities MUST produce logs that record exceptions, faults, and information security events. When necessary for security reasons, logs SHOULD capture user activities with a level of detail that is appropriate and sufficient to meet security requirements, ensuring that the data collected is relevant and not excessive. Logs SHOULD be reviewed regularly to ensure that security incidents are identified and addressed promptly.

- **A.12.4.1 Event Logging**: Organizational Entities MUST establish procedures for logging events, including the types of events to be logged, the information to be captured, and the retention period for logs.

- **A.12.4.2 Protection of Log Information**: Organizational Entities MUST be protected against unauthorized access and tampering. This includes implementing access controls, encryption, and integrity checks to ensure that log data remains secure and reliable.

- **A.12.4.3 Administrator and Operator Logs**: Activities of system administrators and operators MUST be logged and reviewed regularly. Organizational Entities MUST detect unauthorized activities and ensures accountability for actions taken on critical systems.

- **A.12.4.4 Clock Synchronization**: All Organizational Entities' systems involved in logging MUST be synchronized to a reliable time source, ensuring accurate timestamps for correlating events across different systems and conducting effective forensic investigations.

- **A.16.1.7 Information Security Incident Management**: Organizational Entities MUST ensure that logs are available and reliable to support incident management processes.
