Wallet Attestation
------------------------------


Wallet Attestation contains information regarding the security level of the device hosting the Wallet Instance.
It primarily certifies the **authenticity**, **integrity**, **security**, **privacy**, and **trustworthiness** of a particular Wallet Instance.

Wallet Attestation Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The requirements for the Wallet Attestation are defined below:

- The Wallet Attestation MUST contain a Wallet Instance public key.
- The Wallet Attestation MUST use the signed JSON Web Token (JWT) format;
- The Wallet Attestation MUST provide all the relevant information to attest to the **integrity** and **security** of the device where the Wallet Instance is installed.
- The Wallet Attestation MUST be signed by the Wallet Provider that has authority over and is the owner of the Wallet Solution, as specified by the overseeing registration authority. This ensures that the Wallet Attestation uniquely links the Wallet Provider to this particular Wallet Instance.
- The Wallet Provider MUST ensure the integrity, authenticity, and genuineness of the Wallet Instance, preventing any attempts at manipulation or falsification by unauthorized third parties. The Wallet Provider MUST also verify the Wallet Instance using the App Store vendor's API, such as the *Play Integrity API* for Android and *DeviceCheck* for iOS. These services are defined in this specification as **Device Integrity Service (DIS)**.
- The Wallet Attestation MUST have a mechanism in place for revoking the Wallet Instance, allowing the Wallet Provider to terminate service for a specific instance at any time.
- The Wallet Attestation MUST be securely bound to the Wallet Instance's ephemeral public key.
- The Wallet Attestation MAY be used multiple times during its validity period, allowing for repeated authentication and authorization without the need to request new attestations with each interaction.
- The Wallet Attestation MUST be short-lived and MUST have an expiration date/time, after which it SHOULD no longer be considered valid.
- The Wallet Attestation MUST NOT be issued by the Wallet Provider if the authenticity, integrity, and genuineness are not guaranteed. In this case, the Wallet Instance MUST be revoked.
- Each Wallet Instance SHOULD be able to request multiple attestations with different ephemeral public keys associated with them. This requirement provides a privacy-preserving measure, as the public key MAY be used as a tracking tool during the presentation phase (see also the point listed below).
- The Wallet Attestation MUST NOT contain any information that can be used to directly identify the User.
- The Wallet Instance MUST secure a Wallet Attestation as a prerequisite for transitioning to the Operational state, as defined by `ARF`_.
- Private keys MUST be generated and stored in the WSCD using at least one of the approaches listed below:

  - **Local Internal WSCD**: The WSCD relies entirely on the device's native cryptographic hardware, such as the Secure Enclave on iOS devices or the Hardware-Backed Keystore or Strongbox on Android devices.
  - **Local External WSCD**: The WSCD is hardware external to the User's device, such as a smart card compliant with *GlobalPlatform* and supporting *JavaCard*.
  - **Remote WSCD**: The WSCD utilizes a remote Hardware Security Module (HSM).
  - **Local Hybrid WSCD**: The WSCD involves a pluggable internal hardware component within the User's device, such as an *eUICC* that adheres to *GlobalPlatform* standards and supports *JavaCard*.
  - **Remote Hybrid WSCD**: The WSCD involves a local component mixed with a remote service.

- The Wallet Provider MUST offer a set of services, exclusively available to its Wallet Solution instances, for the issuance of Wallet Attestations.

.. warning::
  At the current stage, the implementation profile defined in this document supports only the **Local Internal WSCD**. Future versions of this specification MAY include other approaches depending on the required `AAL`.


Wallet Attestation Issuance

**Step 1**: The User initiates a new operation that necessitates the acquisition of a Wallet Attestation.

**Steps 2-3**: The Wallet Instance MUST:

  1. Verify the existence of Cryptographic Hardware Keys. If none exist, Wallet Instance re-initialization is required.
  2. Generate an ephemeral asymmetric key pair for Wallet Attestation, linking the public key to the attestation.
  3. Verify the Wallet Provider's federation membership and retrieve its metadata.


**Steps 4-6**: The Wallet Instance solicits a one-time "challenge" from the `nonce endpoint`_ of the Wallet Provider Backend. This "challenge" takes the form of a ``nonce``, which is required to be unpredictable and serves as the main defense against replay attacks. 
The ``nonce`` MUST be produced in a manner that ensures its single-use within a predetermined time frame.

.. code-block:: http

    GET /nonce HTTP/1.1
    Host: walletprovider.example.com

.. code-block:: http

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "nonce": "d2JhY2NhbG91cmVqdWFuZGFt"
    }


If an error occurs during ``nonce`` generation, the Wallet Provider MUST return an error response.


**Step 7**: The Wallet Instance performs the following actions:

  * Creates ``client_data``, a JSON object that includes the challenge and the thumbprint of ephemeral public ``jwk``.
  * Computes ``client_data_hash`` by applying the ``SHA256`` algorithm to the ``client_data``.

Below is a non-normative example of the ``client_data`` JSON object.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "challenge": "0fe3cbe0-646d-44b5-8808-917dd5391bd9",
    "jwk_thumbprint": "vbeXJksM45xphtANnCiG6mCyuU4jfGNzopGuKvogg9c"
  }

**Steps 8-10**: The Wallet Instance:

  *  produces an ``hardware_signature`` value by signing the ``client_data_hash`` with the Wallet Hardware's private key, serving as a proof of possession for the Cryptographic Hardware Keys.
  *  requests the Device Integrity Service to create an ``integrity_assertion`` value linked to the ``client_data_hash``.
  *  receives a signed ``integrity_assertion`` value from the Device Integrity Service, authenticated by the OEM.

.. note:: ``integrity_assertion`` is a custom payload generated by Device Integrity Service, signed by device OEM and encoded in base64 to have uniformity between different devices.

**Steps 11-12**: The Wallet Instance:

  * Constructs the Wallet Attestation Request in the form of a JWT. This JWT includes the ``integrity_assertion``, ``hardware_signature``, ``challenge``, ``hardware_key_tag``, ``cnf`` and other configuration related parameters (see :ref:`Table of the Wallet Attestation Request Body <table_wallet_attestation_request_claim>` below) and is signed using the private key of the initially generated ephemeral key pair.
  * Submits the Wallet Attestation Request to the `wallet-attestation endpoint`_ of the Wallet Provider Backend.

Below is a non-normative example of the Wallet Attestation Request JWT without encoding and signature applied:

.. code-block::

        },
        "jwt_vp_json": {

    ],
    "presentation_definition_uri_supported": false,
    "iat": 1686645115,
    "exp": 1686652315
  }

The Wallet Instance MUST send an HTTP request to the Wallet Provider's `wallet-attestation endpoint`_, using the `POST` method with ``Content-Type`` ``application/json``. The request body MUST contain an ``assertion`` parameter whose value is the signed JWT of the Wallet Attestation Request.

.. code-block:: http

    POST /wallet-attestation HTTP/1.1
    Host: wallet-provider.example.org
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "assertion": "eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImtoakZWTE9nRjNHeG..."
    }

**Steps 13-17**: The Wallet Provider Backend evaluates the Wallet Attestation Request and MUST perform the following checks:

    1. The request MUST include all required HTTP header parameters as defined in :ref:`Table of the Wallet Attestation Request Header <table_wallet_attestation_request_claim>`.
    2. The signature of the Wallet Attestation Request MUST be valid and verifiable using the provided ``jwk``.
    3. The ``challenge`` value MUST have been generated by the Wallet Provider and not previously used.
    4. A valid and currently registered Wallet Instance associated with the provided MUST exist.
    5. The ``client_data`` MUST be reconstructed using the ``challenge`` and the ``jwk`` public key.  The ``hardware_signature`` parameter value is then validated using the registered Cryptographic Hardware Key's public key associated with the Wallet Instance.
    6. The ``integrity_assertion`` MUST be validated according to the device manufacturer's guidelines.  The specific checks performed by the Wallet Provider are detailed in the operating system manufacturer's documentation.
    7. The device in use MUST be free of known security flaws and meet the minimum security requirements defined by the Wallet Provider.
    8. The URL in the ``iss`` parameter MUST match the Wallet Provider's URL identifier.

Upon successful completion of all checks, the Wallet Provider issues a Wallet Attestation valid for a maximum of 24 hours.

Below is a non-normative example of the Wallet Attestation without encoding and signature applied:

  }

**Step 18**: Upon successful completion, the Wallet Provider MUST return an HTTP response with a status code of ``200 OK``, containing the Wallet Attestation signed by the Wallet Provider. The Wallet Instance will then perform security, integrity, and trust verification of the Wallet Attestation and its issuer.


Below is a non-normative example of the response.
